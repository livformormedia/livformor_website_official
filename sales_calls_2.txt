This
 
meeting
 
is
 
being
 
recorded.
 
Hi,
 
Corey.
 
Can
 
you
 
hear
 
me?
 
 
@0:06
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yes.
 
 
@0:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Just
 
a
 
second.
 
Let
 
me
 
switch
 
my
 
phones
 
up.
 
Speak.
 
See
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
hear
 
you.
 
 
@0:16
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yes.
 
 
@0:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
How's
 
it
 
going?
 
 
@0:20
 
-
 
Corey
 
Okay.
 
 
@0:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Great.
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
turn
 
on
 
your
 
camera
 
or
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
without
 
a
 
camera
 
today?
 
 
@0:26
 
-
 
Corey
 
I
 
can
 
be
 
on
 
camera
 
here
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
five
 
or
 
so
 
minutes
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
can
 
switch
 
off
 
here.
 
 
@0:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
No
 
problem.
 
So
 
thank
 
you
 
for
 
hopping
 
on
 
the
 
call.
 
Good
 
thing
 
I
 
called
 
you.
 
It
 
seems
 
like
 
you're
 
extremely
 
busy.
 
 
@0:40
 
-
 
Corey
 
So
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
you
 
about
 
how
 
your
 
dog
 
is
 
today.
 
 
@0:43

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
extremely
 
efficient
 
and
 
direct
 
with
 
this
 
call,
 
make
 
you
 
understand.
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
doing,
 
then
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
we
 
do.
 
And
 
if
 
it
 
sounds
 
good
 
to
 
you,
 
we
 
can
 
work
 
together.
 
If
 
not,
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
send
 
you
 
resources
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
for
 
your
 
clinic's
 
growth
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Sounds
 
good.
 
 
@0:57
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
we
 
had.
 
We
 
have
 
three
 
psychiatric
 
clinics.
 
We
 
do
 
intramuscular
 
ketamine,
 
Spravato,
 
and
 
TMS.
 
And
 
we've
 
been
 
using
 
a
 
marketing
 
company
 
for
 
TMS
 
or
 
Rise4.
 
And
 
they
 
are
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
like
 
rinsing
 
and
 
repeating,
 
like
 
using
 
other
 
marketing
 
campaigns
 
that
 
they've
 
used
 
on
 
other
 
people,
 
right?
 
 
@1:26

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Earlier
 
in
 
the
 
year,
 
I
 
saw
 
some
 
ads
 
on
 
another
 
company,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
rotate
 
it
 
through,
 
right?
 
 
@1:33
 
-
 
Corey
 
There's
 
nothing
 
custom
 
about
 
it.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
we're
 
seeing
 
a
 
decline
 
in
 
patients
 
right
 
now.
 
You
 
know,
 
I'm
 
down
 
about
 
eight
 
to
 
10
 
patients
 
a
 
day
 
currently,
 
even
 
though
 
I'm
 
spending
 
more
 
with
 
them.
 
They
 
keep
 
having
 
me
 
put
 
more
 
money
 
in,
 
and
 
I'm
 
not
 
getting
 
any
 
more
 
return.
 
 
@1:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
So...
 
It
 
sounds
 
like
 
if
 
I
 
summarize
 
it,
 
sounds
 
like
 
basically
 
you're
 
doing
 
what
 
everybody
 
else
 
is
 
and
 
what
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about
 
in
 
my
 
ads,
 
which
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
this
 
is
 
why
 
you
 
opted
 
in,
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
ads,
 
rotating
 
through
 
them,
 
everybody's
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
stock
 
photos,
 
same
 
Spravato
 
images,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
how
 
long,
 
how
 
long
 
has,
 
like,
 
when
 
have
 
you
 
seen
 
the
 
decline
 
from?
 
Like,
 
what's
 
the
 
trend
 
of
 
it?
 
 
@2:21
 
-
 
Corey
 
Since
 
June.
 
 
@2:22

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Since
 
June.
 
How
 
long
 
have
 
you
 
been
 
working
 
with
 
them?
 
 
@2:28
 
-
 
Corey
 
Almost
 
two
 
years.
 
 
@2:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@2:32
 
-
 
Corey
 
It
 
was,
 
we
 
were
 
doing
 
pretty
 
well
 
for
 
a
 
while.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
leads
 
were
 
actually
 
coming
 
in.
 
And
 
then
 
all
 
of
 
a
 
sudden,
 
like,
 
it
 
was
 
around
 
June,
 
they,
 
like,
 
we
 
just
 
stopped
 
getting
 
quality
 
leads.
 
Um,
 
or
 
they
 
were
 
all
 
just
 
straight
 
medical.
 
Um,
 
and,
 
um,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
went
 
from,
 
you
 
know,
 
22
 
to
 
24
 
people
 
a
 
day
 
on
 
TMS
 
down
 
to
 
13,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
that's
 
kind
 
of
 
where
 
we've
 
kind
 
of
 
stayed
 
the
 
last
 
couple
 
of
 
months.
 
 
@3:13
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
what,
 
what
 
did
 
they
 
propose
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
situation
 
today?
 
 
@3:20
 
-
 
Corey
 
They
 
wanted
 
to
 
reallocate
 
more
 
money
 
towards
 
Google
 
versus
 
Meta.
 
They
 
said
 
that
 
something
 
happened
 
with
 
Meta
 
where
 
they
 
can't,
 
like,
 
qualify
 
leads
 
or
 
something,
 
like
 
requesting
 
certain
 
information
 
in
 
there,
 
but
 
Google
 
still
 
allows
 
it
 
for
 
collecting
 
more
 
data
 
from
 
them
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
quality
 
lead.
 
So
 
we
 
reallocated
 
money
 
towards
 
Google
 
instead
 
of
 
Meta.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
also
 
started
 
paying
 
for
 
their
 
answering
 
service
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
calls
 
were.
 
We're.
 
Picked
 
up
 
right
 
away,
 
even
 
if
 
we
 
were
 
busy,
 
they
 
had
 
someone
 
that
 
would
 
answer
 
text
 
and
 
calls.
 
They're
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
you're
 
not
 
answering
 
them
 
right
 
away,
 
if
 
you're
 
like
 
in
 
a
 
session
 
or
 
whatever
 
else,
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
call
 
them
 
back,
 
the
 
chances
 
of
 
them
 
actually
 
following
 
through
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
limited.
 
So
 
I've
 
started
 
doing
 
that
 
as
 
well
 
the
 
last
 
two
 
months.
 
And
 
I
 
haven't
 
seen
 
any
 
difference
 
in
 
that.
 
I
 
mean,
 
frees
 
up
 
my
 
time
 
a
 
little
 
bit,
 
but
 
that's
 
about
 
it.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
that
 
it's
 
fully
 
worth,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
they're
 
charging
 
me.
 
 
@4:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm
 
hmm.
 
Okay.
 
 
@4:44
 
-
 
Corey
 
So
 
what
 
is
 
it
 
that
 
you
 
guys
 
do?
 
Okay.
 
 
@4:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
what
 
is
 
different?
 
Okay.
 
So
 
remember,
 
you
 
said
 
that
 
they're
 
rotating
 
through
 
the
 
same
 
ads.
 
And
 
using
 
ads
 
from
 
other
 
people.
 
When
 
you
 
saw
 
the
 
same
 
ads,
 
this
 
is
 
our
 
biggest
 
differentiator,
 
okay,
 
because
 
with
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
work,
 
not
 
only
 
we
 
don't
 
use
 
these
 
same
 
types
 
of
 
ads,
 
because
 
honestly,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
Corey,
 
if
 
you
 
had
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
what's
 
called
 
the
 
ad
 
library
 
in
 
Facebook
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
clinics
 
are
 
running,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
It's
 
either
 
the
 
person
 
in
 
a
 
TMS
 
machine,
 
or
 
it's
 
a
 
brain
 
versus
 
brain
 
ad,
 
or
 
if
 
it's
 
bravado,
 
then
 
it's
 
a
 
picture
 
of
 
a
 
person
 
smiling
 
with
 
the
 
nasal
 
spray.
 
It's
 
the
 
same
 
types
 
of
 
ads.
 
Do
 
you
 
agree
 
with
 
me?
 
 
@5:40
 
-
 
Corey
 
Mm-hmm.
 
 
@5:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
not
 
only
 
do
 
we
 
not
 
use
 
these
 
ads,
 
we
 
basically
 
force
 
you,
 
quote
 
unquote,
 
to
 
film
 
video
 
ads,
 
okay?
 
Do
 
you
 
know?
 
 
@5:55
 
-
 
Corey
 
They
 
requested
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
a
 
video
 
ad.
 
I
 
told
 
them
 
yes.
 
what
 
that
 
maybe
 
They
 
said
 
they
 
would
 
send
 
me
 
a
 
transcript
 
and
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
and
 
everything,
 
and
 
they
 
never
 
followed
 
through
 
with
 
it.
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
two
 
of
 
their
 
ads
 
that
 
they're
 
running
 
right
 
now
 
that
 
earlier
 
in
 
the
 
year,
 
in
 
January,
 
they
 
were
 
running
 
at
 
a
 
competitor's
 
company.
 
But
 
even
 
these
 
here,
 
they're
 
not
 
formatted
 
appropriately
 
for
 
Instagram
 
or
 
whatever
 
else
 
because
 
all
 
the
 
words
 
are
 
covered
 
up
 
and
 
jumbled
 
up.
 
You
 
know,
 
so
 
I
 
was
 
jumping
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
them
 
this
 
morning
 
after
 
this
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
them
 
about
 
why
 
they
 
have
 
these
 
looking
 
so
 
poorly.
 
 
@6:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
with
 
the
 
video
 
ad,
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
they
 
didn't
 
send
 
the
 
script
 
just
 
means,
 
in
 
my
 
eyes,
 
and
 
correct
 
me
 
if
 
I'm
 
wrong,
 
one
 
thing,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
urgent
 
for
 
them.
 
And
 
I
 
honestly
 
think,
 
and
 
maybe
 
not
 
be
 
nice,
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
you
 
pushed
 
enough
 
on
 
them
 
to
 
make
 
changes.
 
Because,
 
us,
 
we
 
actually...
 
actually...
 
80%
 
of
 
the
 
time,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
go
 
live
 
unless
 
we
 
have
 
video
 
ads.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
go
 
live
 
because
 
we
 
know
 
how
 
important
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
are,
 
okay?
 
And
 
not
 
because
 
it's
 
a
 
video
 
ad,
 
it's
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
messaging
 
and
 
what
 
you're
 
portraying
 
in
 
that
 
ad,
 
okay?
 
So
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
with
 
these
 
video
 
ads,
 
it's
 
not
 
just
 
having,
 
it's
 
not
 
about
 
having
 
a
 
script
 
and
 
saying
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
that
 
they
 
say
 
on
 
the
 
regular
 
ads,
 
just
 
in
 
video.
 
No,
 
the
 
entire
 
messaging
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
changed,
 
and
 
you
 
probably
 
didn't
 
have
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
videos
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you,
 
but
 
we
 
basically
 
have
 
this
 
thing
 
called
 
the,
 
you
 
have,
 
went
 
through
 
them
 
or
 
haven't?
 
 
@7:39
 
-
 
Corey
 
No,
 
no,
 
you
 
just
 
sent
 
them
 
this
 
morning.
 
 
@7:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
thing
 
called
 
the
 
belief
 
bridge
 
method,
 
okay?
 
So
 
what's
 
the
 
biggest
 
problem
 
that
 
our
 
potential
 
patients
 
have?
 
Can
 
you
 
tell
 
me
 
in
 
like
 
one
 
sentence,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
their
 
biggest
 
problem
 
is?
 
 
@7:57
 
-
 
Corey
 
What,
 
why
 
they're
 
seeking
 
out?
 
 
@7:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
 
@8:00
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yeah,
 
just
 
feeling
 
kind
 
of
 
lost
 
and
 
nothing
 
will
 
work
 
for
 
them
 
because
 
they've
 
been
 
through,
 
you
 
know,
 
many
 
different
 
trials
 
of
 
meds
 
and
 
nothing
 
seems
 
to
 
work.
 
 
@8:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm
 
hmm.
 
That's
 
right.
 
So
 
basically
 
in
 
their
 
brain,
 
they
 
have
 
an
 
identity
 
crisis,
 
I
 
guess
 
you
 
could
 
say,
 
because
 
they're
 
being
 
labeled
 
as
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
treatment
 
resistant
 
depression.
 
Which
 
means
 
if
 
we
 
offer
 
them
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
saying,
 
oh,
 
there's
 
this
 
FDA
 
approved
 
thing,
 
there's
 
this,
 
this
 
and
 
this
 
and
 
that.
 
We're
 
not
 
accomplishing
 
anything.
 
We're
 
just
 
changing
 
the
 
suit.
 
What
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
break
 
their
 
beliefs
 
and
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
build
 
new
 
beliefs.
 
So
 
there's
 
basically
 
five
 
stages
 
to
 
that.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
say,
 
OK,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
you're
 
believing.
 
I
 
am
 
treatment
 
resistant.
 
It's
 
wrong.
 
OK,
 
why
 
is
 
this
 
wrong?
 
Then
 
we
 
explain
 
why
 
it's
 
wrong.
 
We
 
explain
 
how
 
traditional
 
antidepressants
 
were
 
meant
 
to
 
manage
 
symptoms,
 
doing
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Then
 
we
 
tell
 
them,
 
OK,
 
this
 
is
 
what's
 
right.
 
TMS
 
provato.
 
Or
 
ketamine
 
is
 
right.
 
This
 
is
 
why
 
it's
 
right.
 
We
 
explained
 
the
 
mechanism
 
behind
 
it.
 
And
 
the
 
last
 
thing
 
we
 
do
 
is
 
provide
 
proof.
 
Proof
 
can
 
be
 
testimonials
 
showing
 
other
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
in
 
their
 
shoes
 
and
 
doing
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
This
 
is
 
all
 
we
 
do.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
entire
 
process
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
ads.
 
And
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
actually
 
execute
 
upon
 
that?
 
We
 
have
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
scripts.
 
It
 
could
 
be
 
educational
 
scripts.
 
It
 
could
 
be
 
scripts
 
that
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
testimonials
 
and
 
patient
 
stories.
 
And
 
we
 
always,
 
once
 
a
 
month,
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
once
 
a
 
month
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
batch
 
of
 
testimonials,
 
creating
 
new
 
ads
 
from
 
these
 
testimonials,
 
getting
 
you
 
to
 
film
 
these
 
ads,
 
and
 
then
 
running
 
with
 
them.
 
So
 
the
 
ads
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
your
 
results.
 
And
 
they're
 
not
 
relying
 
on
 
us
 
or
 
on
 
our
 
creative
 
mind.
 
Because
 
honestly,
 
Corey,
 
we're
 
not
 
trying
 
to
 
reinvent
 
the
 
wheel.
 
We're
 
trying
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
psychology.
 
Okay?
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
our
 
biggest
 
differentiator.
 
That's
 
number
 
one.
 
Number
 
two,
 
and
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
have
 
Any
 
idea
 
as
 
to
 
what's
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
cost
 
per
 
booking,
 
cost
 
per
 
show,
 
cost
 
per
 
acquired
 
patient
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
couple
 
of
 
months?
 
 
@10:11
 
-
 
Corey
 
Well,
 
since
 
June,
 
it's
 
been
 
about
 
$750
 
a
 
patient.
 
 
@10:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
this
 
is,
 
and
 
is
 
this
 
number
 
including...
 
 
@10:23
 
-
 
Corey
 
Last
 
month
 
was
 
more.
 
 
@10:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Is
 
this
 
number
 
including
 
the,
 
the,
 
the
 
marketing
 
fee
 
of
 
4-Eyes
 
or
 
no?
 
 
@10:33
 
-
 
Corey
 
Um,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
don't,
 
they,
 
they
 
sent
 
a
 
breakdown.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
they
 
included
 
in
 
that
 
or
 
not.
 
Let
 
me
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
calculate
 
in
 
my
 
head
 
here.
 
had
 
seven,
 
you
 
know,
 
that,
 
that's
 
including
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
the
 
CRM.
 
 
@10:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
 
@10:51
 
-
 
Corey
 
think...
 
Because
 
whenever
 
I
 
break
 
it
 
down
 
in
 
my
 
head
 
for,
 
uh,
 
the,
 
the
 
cost
 
that
 
I
 
paid
 
them
 
on
 
the
 
card,
 
and
 
we
 
had,
 
um...
 
Eight
 
leads
 
on
 
it
 
that
 
convert
 
it,
 
so
 
yeah,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
including
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
that.
 
 
@11:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
the
 
patient
 
is...
 
 
@11:10
 
-
 
Corey
 
So
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
lower.
 
 
@11:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it's
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
the
 
advertising
 
spend,
 
the
 
CRM,
 
and
 
also
 
what
 
you're
 
paying
 
them.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
you
 
calculate.
 
Great,
 
okay,
 
so
 
that's
 
a
 
green
 
flag
 
for
 
me.
 
Good
 
job
 
on
 
them
 
for
 
doing
 
that.
 
I
 
actually
 
expected
 
you
 
to
 
say
 
that
 
you
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
number
 
is.
 
So
 
that's
 
good.
 
I'm
 
glad
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
that.
 
 
@11:27
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yeah,
 
was
 
like
 
7.48
 
a
 
lead
 
is
 
what
 
it
 
was
 
last
 
month,
 
yeah.
 
 
@11:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm,
 
okay,
 
a
 
lead
 
or
 
acquired
 
patient?
 
A
 
converted
 
patient.
 
Okay,
 
okay,
 
great.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
in
 
this
 
sense,
 
and
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
booking,
 
cost
 
per
 
show,
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
all
 
these
 
things,
 
are
 
they
 
included,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
just
 
mainly
 
know
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
patient?
 
 
@11:52
 
-
 
Corey
 
I
 
don't,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
that.
 
I
 
don't
 
really,
 
I
 
was
 
only
 
focusing
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
actual...
 
 
@12:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Converted
 
patients
 
that
 
came
 
through,
 
that's
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
I
 
was
 
tracking.
 
Yeah,
 
makes
 
sense.
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
And
 
I
 
understand.
 
Now,
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
in
 
our
 
process
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
basically
 
five
 
metrics
 
that
 
we
 
track,
 
okay,
 
on
 
top
 
of,
 
including,
 
sorry,
 
cost
 
per
 
patient,
 
because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
we
 
have
 
an
 
entire
 
funnel
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
through,
 
the
 
patient
 
goes
 
through,
 
there's
 
the
 
lead
 
stage,
 
or
 
they
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
landing
 
page,
 
then
 
there's
 
the
 
booking
 
page,
 
then
 
there's
 
the
 
show
 
up,
 
and
 
then
 
there's
 
the
 
close,
 
okay,
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
four
 
pillars.
 
There's
 
also
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
conversion,
 
but
 
we're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
touch
 
upon
 
that.
 
And
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
basically
 
every
 
two
 
weeks,
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
stats,
 
see
 
where
 
our
 
bottlenecks
 
are,
 
and
 
we
 
basically
 
improve
 
upon
 
them.
 
So
 
if
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
show
 
rate
 
problem,
 
for
 
example,
 
10
 
people
 
booked,
 
and
 
only
 
four
 
people
 
showed,
 
okay,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
inside
 
and
 
understand
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
in
 
there.
 
Is
 
it
 
because
 
we're
 
booking
 
people
 
too
 
far
 
away?
 
Do
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
with
 
our
 
reminders?
 
Do
 
we
 
not
 
add
 
enough
 
value?
 
Do
 
they
 
not
 
trust
 
us
 
enough?
 
We
 
basically
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
in
 
inside
 
each
 
and
 
every
 
metric
 
and
 
see,
 
okay.
 
How
 
can
 
we
 
prove
 
upon
 
that?
 
So
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
lower
 
cost
 
per
 
patient,
 
acquired
 
patient.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
second
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
do.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
the
 
third
 
thing
 
is
 
just
 
repeating.
 
We
 
just
 
repeat
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
This
 
is
 
honestly,
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
do.
 
It's
 
a
 
creative
 
and
 
optimization.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
just
 
create
 
new
 
ads
 
every
 
single
 
month
 
based
 
on
 
testimonials
 
and
 
based
 
on
 
patient
 
results.
 
And
 
that
 
is
 
basically
 
it.
 
It's
 
very,
 
very
 
simple.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@13:35
 
-
 
Corey
 
And
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
as
 
far
 
as,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
guys
 
for
 
advertising,
 
you
 
know,
 
do
 
you
 
agree
 
with
 
them
 
on
 
switching
 
more
 
of
 
our
 
stuff
 
out
 
of
 
Meta
 
into
 
Google?
 
 
@13:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@13:49
 
-
 
Corey
 
That's
 
a
 
good
 
question.
 
they
 
said
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
recent
 
change
 
in
 
Meta's
 
rules
 
for
 
advertising
 
for
 
Sprobato,
 
Ketamine,
 
behavioral
 
health
 
items.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
It
 
no
 
longer
 
allows
 
them
 
to
 
collect
 
certain
 
items.
 
Is
 
that
 
factual
 
or
 
are
 
they
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
suggest
 
a
 
switch
 
to
 
look
 
like
 
they're
 
doing
 
something?
 
 
@14:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it
 
is
 
true
 
that
 
Meta
 
has
 
made
 
a
 
change
 
with
 
certain
 
information
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
collect.
 
With
 
that
 
being
 
said,
 
though,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
because
 
you
 
can
 
still
 
qualify
 
people
 
before
 
they
 
book
 
a
 
call.
 
You
 
can
 
ask
 
them
 
what
 
their
 
insurance
 
is.
 
You
 
can
 
ask
 
them
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
condition
 
that
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
solve.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
ask
 
them
 
what
 
their
 
treatment
 
goals
 
are.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
still
 
ask
 
these
 
questions.
 
You
 
cannot
 
ask
 
people,
 
oh,
 
how
 
many
 
medications
 
did
 
you
 
take?
 
Or
 
you
 
cannot
 
ask
 
them,
 
oh,
 
are
 
you
 
clinically
 
diagnosed
 
with
 
depression?
 
And
 
you
 
cannot
 
ask
 
these
 
very
 
specific
 
questions
 
that
 
imply,
 
you
 
a
 
certain
 
medical
 
condition.
 
But
 
you
 
can
 
ask
 
other
 
questions
 
that
 
will
 
still
 
qualify
 
people
 
and
 
create
 
friction.
 
And
 
another
 
question
 
is,
 
does
 
4Eyes
 
use
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
or
 
do
 
they
 
use
 
the
 
Facebook
 
page?
 
 
@15:00
 
-
 
Corey
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
for
 
TMS,
 
have
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
for
 
Spravato,
 
and
 
they're
 
building
 
us
 
one
 
for
 
General
 
Psyche
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@15:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
awesome.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
user
 
landing
 
pages
 
is
 
good.
 
Now,
 
what
 
they
 
said
 
about
 
the
 
data,
 
it
 
is
 
true,
 
still
 
doesn't
 
mean
 
that
 
you
 
cannot
 
get
 
qualified
 
leads.
 
That's
 
not
 
true.
 
Switching
 
to
 
Google
 
also,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion,
 
is
 
a
 
mistake.
 
Maybe
 
I'm
 
biased
 
because
 
I
 
hate
 
Google.
 
Actually,
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
for
 
Greenbrook
 
TMS
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
who
 
these
 
guys
 
are.
 
They
 
are
 
in
 
a
 
huge
 
lawsuit
 
with
 
Google
 
because
 
a
 
third
 
of
 
their
 
clicks
 
is
 
click
 
fraud.
 
So
 
I'd
 
much
 
rather
 
focus
 
on
 
Google
 
as
 
a
 
back-end
 
bone.
 
Like,
 
for
 
example,
 
people
 
see
 
you,
 
then
 
they
 
search
 
for
 
you
 
up
 
on
 
Google,
 
and
 
you
 
show
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
Google
 
Maps
 
results
 
and
 
also
 
in
 
a
 
branding
 
campaign
 
in
 
Google.
 
That's
 
what
 
I
 
mostly
 
use
 
Google
 
for.
 
I
 
like
 
to
 
use
 
Facebook
 
because
 
it's
 
an
 
interrupted-based
 
platform.
 
with
 
why
 
accepting
 
and
 
because
 
Because
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
to
 
people
 
that
 
don't
 
know
 
the
 
solution,
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
way
 
more
 
eyeballs,
 
and
 
also
 
you
 
can
 
track
 
the
 
results
 
way
 
better,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion,
 
and
 
with
 
Google
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
a
 
ton
 
of
 
click
 
fraud,
 
and
 
you
 
wouldn't
 
even
 
know,
 
like
 
you
 
wouldn't
 
know.
 
 
@16:16
 
-
 
Corey
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
other
 
reasons
 
they
 
wanted
 
to
 
switch
 
to
 
Google
 
was
 
because
 
those
 
leads
 
that
 
we
 
got
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
months,
 
they've
 
been
 
all
 
Medi-Cal.
 
So
 
they
 
said
 
on
 
Google
 
they
 
could
 
set
 
different
 
income
 
thresholds
 
to
 
target
 
different
 
income
 
levels
 
that
 
may
 
have
 
commercial
 
insurance
 
versus
 
Medi-Cal.
 
And
 
they
 
said
 
on
 
Facebook
 
they
 
couldn't
 
do
 
that.
 
 
@16:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
don't,
 
I
 
cannot
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
definitive
 
answer
 
on
 
that,
 
okay.
 
I
 
do
 
know
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
filter
 
out
 
people
 
with
 
income
 
levels
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
You
 
can
 
do
 
that.
 
But
 
also...
 
also...
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
send
 
the
 
best
 
leads
 
back
 
to
 
Facebook,
 
okay,
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
tell
 
Facebook
 
when
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
patient
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
converted,
 
Facebook
 
knows
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
patient,
 
usually
 
that
 
patient
 
would
 
not
 
have
 
Medi-Cal.
 
So
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
that
 
information
 
back
 
to
 
Facebook,
 
Facebook
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
understand
 
what
 
a
 
patient
 
is,
 
and
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
optimize
 
the
 
data
 
towards
 
that.
 
It
 
doesn't,
 
like
 
the
 
targeting
 
doesn't
 
really
 
make
 
a
 
change.
 
And
 
also,
 
if
 
you
 
guys
 
really
 
don't
 
want
 
people
 
with
 
Medi-Cal,
 
we
 
can
 
disqualify
 
these
 
people.
 
We
 
can
 
disqualify
 
these
 
people.
 
 
@17:32
 
-
 
Corey
 
Well,
 
we
 
accept
 
Medi-Cal,
 
we
 
just
 
want
 
a
 
good
 
mix
 
because
 
they
 
pay
 
so
 
little.
 
You
 
know,
 
I'd
 
much
 
rather
 
have,
 
you
 
know,
 
someone
 
in
 
my
 
chair,
 
you
 
know,
 
paying
 
for
 
my
 
rent
 
and
 
my
 
staff,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
my
 
chair
 
and
 
everything
 
else,
 
rather
 
than
 
having
 
an
 
empty
 
seat,
 
right?
 
Mm-hmm.
 
But,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
make-
 
Very
 
little
 
on
 
it,
 
okay?
 
 
@18:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
it
 
really
 
depends,
 
we
 
can
 
target,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
there's
 
no
 
definitive
 
solution
 
to
 
that.
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
you,
 
oh,
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
this
 
and
 
this
 
and
 
that.
 
There's
 
no
 
definitive
 
solution.
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
do.
 
We
 
can
 
have
 
messaging
 
that
 
goes
 
to
 
higher
 
level
 
prospects
 
or
 
patients.
 
We
 
can
 
also
 
filter
 
them
 
out
 
with
 
the
 
income
 
levels
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
We
 
can
 
target
 
specific
 
zip
 
codes
 
in
 
your
 
area
 
that
 
people
 
have
 
higher
 
income
 
levels
 
in.
 
And
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
levers
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
pull.
 
And
 
also,
 
correct
 
me
 
if
 
I'm
 
wrong,
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
switched
 
to
 
Google
 
more
 
and
 
have
 
results
 
changed?
 
 
@18:40
 
-
 
Corey
 
They've
 
been
 
about
 
the
 
same.
 
 
@18:42
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
it's
 
not
 
the
 
platform,
 
man.
 
It's
 
something
 
else.
 
 
@18:46
 
-
 
Corey
 
It's
 
the
 
same
 
amount,
 
you
 
know?
 
 
@18:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
not
 
the
 
platform.
 
So,
 
and
 
you've
 
had
 
enough
 
time.
 
They've
 
had
 
enough
 
time
 
to
 
show.
 
Or
 
that
 
it's
 
the
 
platform.
 
It's
 
been
 
four
 
months,
 
as
 
you
 
said,
 
I
 
mean,
 
so,
 
yeah,
 
that
 
is,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I,
 
this
 
is
 
my
 
take
 
on
 
all
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
talked
 
about.
 
 
@19:12
 
-
 
Corey
 
So
 
what,
 
what
 
services,
 
I
 
guess,
 
do
 
you
 
just
 
do,
 
like,
 
the
 
ads?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
whole,
 
like,
 
CRM
 
item
 
like
 
Rise4
 
has?
 
Or
 
what
 
is
 
it
 
that
 
your
 
company
 
does
 
for
 
us?
 
 
@19:36
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
So
 
basically,
 
it's
 
pretty
 
similar
 
to
 
4Rise.
 
They
 
use
 
GoHighLevel,
 
I'm
 
assuming.
 
Is
 
that
 
correct?
 
 
@19:43
 
-
 
Corey
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
this
 
platform?
 
 
@19:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
says,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
GoHighLevel,
 
yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
we
 
also
 
use
 
GoHighLevel.
 
We
 
also
 
manage
 
the
 
ads
 
for
 
you
 
guys.
 
We
 
have
 
B-Weekly
 
calls
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
hop
 
on
 
to
 
optimize,
 
see
 
the
 
stats,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you
 
before.
 
We
 
edit
 
the
 
ads,
 
okay?
 
We
 
send
 
you
 
this.
 
Scripts,
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
Only
 
thing
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
film,
 
and
 
we
 
also
 
have,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
they're
 
doing
 
it,
 
but
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
voice
 
AI
 
agent
 
that
 
calls
 
leads
 
within
 
five
 
minutes
 
to
 
book
 
them
 
inside
 
a
 
consultation
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
guys
 
don't
 
have
 
time,
 
then
 
as
 
you've
 
said,
 
it
 
frees
 
up
 
time
 
for
 
you.
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
that
 
component
 
inside,
 
and
 
we
 
also
 
provide
 
content
 
management
 
if
 
needed.
 
content
 
management,
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
write
 
10
 
scripts
 
a
 
month
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
upload
 
to
 
your
 
social
 
media,
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
basically,
 
it's
 
not
 
to
 
be
 
viral.
 
It's
 
not
 
to
 
get
 
follows.
 
It's
 
to
 
nurture
 
leads.
 
They
 
nurture
 
leads
 
before
 
they
 
come
 
to
 
the
 
clinic.
 
We'll
 
trust
 
with
 
them
 
and
 
do
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
main,
 
main
 
things.
 
 
@20:44
 
-
 
Corey
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
And
 
then
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
cost
 
breakdown
 
for
 
your
 
services?
 
 
@20:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
we
 
basically
 
have
 
two
 
options.
 
Okay.
 
Option
 
number
 
one,
 
it's
 
either
 
a
 
flat
 
$2,500
 
retainer,
 
okay,
 
and
 
that
 
does
 
not
 
include
 
the
 
ad
 
spend,
 
so
 
your
 
ad
 
spend
 
is
 
different
 
from
 
that,
 
or
 
option
 
number
 
two
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
either
 
take
 
$5,000
 
upfront
 
for
 
three
 
months,
 
third
 
month
 
is
 
free,
 
so
 
you
 
pay
 
$2,500
 
for
 
two
 
months,
 
third
 
month
 
is
 
free,
 
and
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
voice
 
AI
 
and
 
the
 
content
 
management
 
for
 
free
 
for
 
30
 
days.
 
These
 
are
 
each
 
$700
 
a
 
month.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
You
 
know,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
bit,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
numbers.
 
 
@21:37
 
-
 
Corey
 
Okay.
 
Now,
 
do
 
you
 
guys,
 
how
 
does,
 
if
 
I
 
were
 
to
 
go
 
with,
 
how
 
would
 
the
 
switch
 
occur
 
on
 
the
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
CRM
 
and
 
all
 
that,
 
like,
 
how
 
would
 
that
 
go?
 
 
@21:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm,
 
so
 
it
 
really
 
depends
 
on
 
four
 
rides,
 
and
 
from,
 
I've
 
had
 
a,
 
I've
 
had
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
with
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
people
 
on
 
four
 
rides.
 
It
 
seems
 
like
 
these
 
guys
 
are,
 
they're
 
decent
 
people.
 
So
 
the
 
way
 
to
 
do
 
it,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
in
 
general,
 
you
 
can
 
always
 
transfer
 
one
 
subaccount
 
in
 
GoHighLevel
 
to
 
another
 
subaccount
 
with
 
a
 
single
 
click.
 
So
 
that
 
transition
 
would
 
ideally
 
be
 
them
 
transitioning
 
the
 
subaccount
 
from
 
their
 
account
 
to
 
our
 
account.
 
That's
 
it.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
everything
 
moved
 
from
 
there,
 
all
 
the
 
data,
 
all
 
the
 
opportunities,
 
everything
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
moved
 
into
 
Argo
 
HighLevel.
 
Obviously
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
though,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
their
 
automations
 
and
 
what
 
they
 
do.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
different
 
process
 
for
 
automations
 
and
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
switch
 
it.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
everything
 
else
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
there.
 
And
 
also
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
landing
 
pages
 
that
 
we
 
use,
 
we
 
have
 
a,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
your
 
landing
 
page,
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
your
 
landing
 
page
 
conversion
 
rate
 
is
 
by
 
any
 
chance?
 
Or
 
is
 
that
 
a
 
stat
 
that
 
you...
 
 
@22:51
 
-
 
Corey
 
What
 
is
 
it?
 
 
@22:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
The
 
landing
 
page
 
conversion
 
rate,
 
like
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
convert.
 
And
 
so,
 
yeah.
 
So
 
we
 
create
 
landing
 
pages
 
on
 
this
 
platform
 
called...
 
Base44.
 
Okay.
 
It's
 
basically
 
like
 
lovable.
 
If
 
you've
 
heard
 
of
 
them,
 
we
 
create
 
the
 
entire
 
structure
 
of
 
the
 
page
 
there.
 
And
 
it's
 
basically
 
a
 
page
 
that
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
convert.
 
Like
 
it's
 
psychologically
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
conversion
 
monster.
 
So
 
can
 
we
 
create
 
it
 
on
 
there?
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
send
 
you
 
an
 
example
 
for
 
you
 
to,
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
it
 
looks.
 
 
@23:18
 
-
 
Corey
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
you're
 
driving,
 
so
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
share
 
my
 
screen
 
now
 
and
 
show
 
you.
 
I'm
 
on
 
my
 
way
 
to
 
work
 
right
 
now
 
because
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
patient
 
that
 
called
 
it,
 
he
 
wanted
 
to
 
come
 
earlier.
 
 
@23:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So.
 
Mm
 
hmm.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
show
 
my
 
screen
 
and
 
show
 
you
 
an
 
example?
 
Are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
see,
 
or?
 
 
@23:33
 
-
 
Corey
 
either,
 
um,
 
um,
 
are
 
you
 
able
 
to
 
send
 
a,
 
like
 
a
 
screenshot,
 
uh,
 
I
 
can,
 
yeah,
 
I'll
 
send
 
you,
 
I'll
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
link.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
link,
 
full
 
link.
 
So.
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
send
 
it
 
to
 
my
 
work
 
email,
 
um,
 
instead
 
of
 
like
 
my,
 
cause
 
like,
 
I
 
think
 
it,
 
this
 
is
 
registered
 
to
 
what
 
my
 
Instagram's
 
on.
 
Cause
 
I
 
found,
 
found
 
you
 
guys
 
on
 
there.
 
Um,
 
so
 
it's
 
just
 
my
 
last
 
name,
 
Scott
 
and
 
first
 
initial
 
C
 
at.
 
SpecificHealthSystems,
 
with
 
an
 
S
 
at
 
the
 
end,
 
.com.
 
 
@24:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
oh,
 
I
 
know.
 
Oh,
 
I
 
didn't
 
understand.
 
So
 
you
 
filled
 
out
 
the
 
marketing
 
audit,
 
and
 
I
 
didn't
 
understand
 
who
 
filled
 
out
 
the
 
marketing
 
audit
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
days
 
ago
 
because
 
you
 
had
 
a
 
completely
 
different
 
email.
 
I
 
have
 
your
 
email.
 
I
 
was
 
wondering,
 
and
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
an
 
email,
 
and
 
you
 
didn't
 
respond.
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
who
 
is
 
this
 
guy?
 
How
 
did
 
he
 
get
 
to
 
the
 
marketing
 
audit?
 
Because
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
completely
 
different
 
email.
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
 
@24:32
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
have
 
your
 
email.
 
It
 
might
 
have
 
went
 
to
 
our
 
spam.
 
Maybe
 
it
 
needs
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
other,
 
my
 
personal.
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
Because
 
my
 
work
 
email
 
has
 
a
 
phishing
 
protector
 
on
 
it
 
and
 
all
 
these
 
other
 
blockers.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
did
 
send
 
it
 
on
 
my
 
other
 
email,
 
I
 
may
 
not
 
have
 
got
 
it
 
because
 
I
 
haven't
 
seen
 
it.
 
 
@24:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@24:55
 
-
 
Corey
 
So
 
maybe
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
keep
 
it
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
one.
 
 
@24:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
I'll
 
just
 
send
 
it
 
up.
 
I'll
 
send
 
it
 
to
 
you
 
via
 
text
 
message
 
and
 
also
 
to
 
your
 
work
 
email.
 
 
@25:05
 
-
 
Corey
 
Can
 
you
 
give
 
me
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
your
 
AI?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
recording
 
of
 
what
 
your
 
AI
 
answering
 
service
 
sounds
 
like?
 
Does
 
it
 
answer
 
basic
 
questions
 
or
 
does
 
it
 
let
 
them
 
know
 
that
 
it's
 
just
 
a
 
booking
 
service?
 
Or
 
do
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
it
 
programmed?
 
Like
 
if
 
they
 
ask
 
like
 
what
 
TMS
 
is
 
or
 
what
 
Spravato
 
is,
 
will
 
it
 
go
 
into
 
detail
 
and
 
respond?
 
Because,
 
you
 
know,
 
at
 
that
 
cost,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
would
 
probably
 
do
 
that
 
over,
 
you
 
know,
 
their
 
live
 
person
 
because
 
they're
 
not
 
really
 
doing
 
much
 
on
 
the
 
live.
 
They
 
got
 
two
 
people
 
assigned
 
to
 
me
 
for
 
live
 
answering
 
and
 
it's
 
4,000
 
a

Okay.
 
That's
 
insane.
 
Holy
 
.
 
Okay.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
explain
 
to
 
you
 
exactly
 
how
 
it
 
works.
 
I
 
can
 
send
 
you
 
recordings
 
as
 
well,
 
by
 
the
 
way.
 
But
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
it
 
works
 
is
 
very
 
simple.
 
There's
 
this
 
platform
 
called
 
Retail,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
master
 
platform
 
to
 
create
 
voice
 
AI.
 
And
 
what
 
you
 
do
 
when
 
you
 
create...
 
Retail,
 
you
 
said?
 
Retail,
 
yeah.
 
Retail
 
AI.
 
That's
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
them.
 
And
 
what
 
you
 
can
 
do,
 
you
 
basically
 
create
 
an
 
agent.
 
And
 
with
 
that
 
agent,
 
what
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
you
 
assign
 
a
 
prompt,
 
you
 
assign
 
the
 
call
 
flow.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
it
 
to
 
ask?
 
How
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
the
 
call
 
flow
 
to
 
go?
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
add
 
a
 
database,
 
a
 
knowledge
 
base
 
to
 
it.
 
So
 
we
 
can
 
basically
 
add
 
your
 
website,
 
we
 
can
 
add
 
your
 
ads,
 
we
 
can
 
add
 
information
 
about
 
TMS,
 
which
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
basically
 
do
 
for
 
every
 
single
 
client.
 
And
 
then
 
the
 
voice
 
AI
 
has
 
in
 
its
 
entire
 
database,
 
the
 
context
 
about
 
your
 
specific
 
clinic,
 
your
 
specific
 
treatments,
 
where
 
your
 
guys'
 
addresses
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
it's
 
basically
 
a
 
care
 
coordinator
 
that
 
is
 
tailored
 
towards
 
your
 
clinic.
 
It's
 
like
 
chat
 
GPT,
 
but
 
in
 
voice.
 
Exact
 
same
 
thing.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I'll
 
get
 
you
 
examples
 
though.
 
 
@26:55
 
-
 
Corey
 
I'll
 
send
 
you
 
examples
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
do
 
you
 
guys
 
do
 
like,
 
if
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
do
 
some
 
of
 
your
 
services,
 
but
 
not
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
to
 
switch
 
over.
 
Do
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
different
 
cost
 
structures
 
to
 
add
 
that,
 
or
 
add
 
certain
 
campaigns
 
to
 
what
 
we
 
already
 
have?
 
 
@27:16

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Can
 
you
 
elaborate?
 
 
@27:18
 
-
 
Corey
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
I
 
understood
 
the
 
question.
 
So
 
if
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
test
 
the
 
waters
 
with
 
running
 
an
 
ad
 
side-by-side
 
with
 
theirs
 
or
 
something,
 
or
 
if
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
cancel
 
their
 
intake
 
service
 
but
 
use
 
your
 
AI
 
answering,
 
are
 
those
 
able
 
to
 
be
 
integrated
 
into
 
our
 
current
 
CRM?
 
 
@27:45
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
can
 
definitely
 
do
 
that.
 
We
 
can
 
run
 
ads
 
side-by-side
 
with
 
them.
 
You
 
can
 
use
 
our
 
voice
 
AI,
 
though
 
if
 
you
 
take
 
the
 
standalone
 
voice
 
AI,
 
it
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
expensive.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$1,000
 
a
 
month
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
take
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Now,
 
with
 
running
 
an
 
Ad
 
side
 
by
 
side
 
next
 
to
 
them,
 
it's
 
possible.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
like
 
it.
 
And
 
we're
 
also
 
probably
 
going
 
to
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
ad
 
account
 
that
 
they're
 
using.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
yeah,
 
we
 
can
 
technically
 
do
 
that.
 
But
 
the
 
cost
 
structure,
 
because
 
we
 
do
 
still
 
do
 
everything
 
in
 
the
 
back
 
and
 
we
 
create
 
the
 
ads,
 
we
 
totally
 
do
 
the
 
videos,
 
there
 
is
 
work
 
that
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
into
 
that.
 
You
 
know,
 
so
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
different
 
cost
 
structure
 
for
 
that.
 
But
 
we,
 
if
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
work
 
something
 
out,
 
depending
 
on
 
what
 
specifically
 
you
 
need.
 
If
 
there's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
obviously
 
way
 
less
 
work
 
on
 
our
 
side
 
with
 
something
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
looking
 
forward
 
to,
 
yeah,
 
we
 
can
 
obviously
 
get
 
something
 
going.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@28:42
 
-
 
Corey
 
Okay,
 
and
 
you
 
guys,
 
you
 
said
 
you're
 
currently
 
working
 
with
 
Greenbrook
 
and
 
Neurostar?
 
 
@28:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
Greenbrook,
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
to
 
Greenbrook
 
specifically.
 
I'm
 
not
 
working,
 
I'm
 
not
 
working,
 
I'm
 
not
 
managing
 
their
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
to
 
them.
 
 
@28:56
 
-
 
Corey
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
Do
 
you
 
have...
 
Different,
 
I
 
guess,
 
case
 
studies
 
of
 
other
 
clinics
 
that
 
have
 
used
 
our
 
marketing
 
company
 
and
 
then,
 
like,
 
a
 
follow-up
 
of
 
what
 
their
 
conversions,
 
like,
 
Rise
 
Forward
 
does
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
TMS
 
clinics
 
in
 
Texas
 
and
 
California,
 
Washington.
 
More
 
West
 
Coast
 
and
 
Southern.
 
So
 
I'm
 
sure
 
you've
 
worked
 
with
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
used
 
them.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
different,
 
I
 
guess,
 
studies
 
of
 
where
 
people
 
have
 
switched
 
and
 
what
 
their
 
conversions
 
have
 
changed
 
to
 
or,
 
like,
 
their
 
revenue
 
streams?
 
 
@29:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
So
 
I'll
 
be
 
100%
 
honest
 
with
 
you.
 
I
 
have
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
marketing
 
industry.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
looked
 
me
 
up
 
or
 
something.
 
But
 
I've
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
marketing
 
industry
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
five
 
years.
 
I'm
 
from
 
Israel,
 
actually.
 
And
 
I've
 
just...
 
So
 
to
 
this
 
specific
 
industry
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
six
 
months
 
because
 
of
 
a
 
simple
 
fact.
 
I
 
didn't
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
Israeli
 
clients
 
anymore.
 
I
 
do
 
still
 
have
 
Israeli
 
clients,
 
but
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
switch
 
to
 
a
 
specific
 
industry
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
I'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
and
 
be
 
a
 
master
 
at.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
you
 
are
 
actually
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
first
 
clients.
 
I'm
 
taking
 
all
 
the
 
principles
 
from
 
what
 
I
 
learned
 
in
 
marketing
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
five
 
years,
 
and
 
I'm
 
inputting
 
it
 
into
 
now.
 
So
 
case
 
studies,
 
no,
 
unfortunately
 
I
 
don't
 
have,
 
and
 
not
 
even
 
specific
 
case
 
studies
 
I've
 
rise
 
for.
 
 
@30:28
 
-
 
Corey
 
Okay.
 
So
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
any
 
other
 
TMS
 
clients
 
right
 
now?
 
 
@30:33
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
TMS
 
clients
 
we
 
do
 
have.
 
Yeah.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
onboarded.
 
Yeah,
 
but
 
not,
 
I
 
can
 
send
 
you
 
their
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
but
 
not
 
enough
 
time
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
actual
 
results.
 
So.
 
 
@30:46
 
-
 
Corey
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
let's,
 
let
 
me
 
see
 
what,
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
email
 
me,
 
like
 
what,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
would
 
look
 
like.
 
First
 
is
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
two
 
examples
 
of
 
their.
 
I
 
wanted
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
focused
 
on
 
military
 
campaigns,
 
because
 
we
 
are
 
right
 
down
 
the
 
street
 
from
 
32nd
 
Street
 
Naval
 
Base
 
here,
 
and
 
our
 
other
 
office
 
is
 
right
 
down
 
the
 
street
 
from
 
Camp
 
Pendleton
 
for
 
the
 
Marines,
 
and
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
those
 
items.
 
So
 
that's
 
what
 
we're
 
looking
 
at
 
right
 
now,
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
more
 
military
 
into
 
our
 
office,
 
we're
 
all
 
credentialed
 
with
 
them,
 
and
 
dependents.
 
And
 
what
 
they
 
did,
 
whenever
 
I
 
asked
 
for
 
that,
 
was
 
they
 
just
 
rinsed
 
and
 
repeated
 
the
 
one
 
with
 
the
 
hands
 
clasp
 
there
 
and
 
had
 
an
 
overlay
 
of
 
an
 
American
 
flag
 
on
 
it.
 
And
 
you
 
can't
 
even
 
read
 
the
 
bottom
 
part
 
about
 
TMS
 
on
 
it,
 
because
 
the
 
meta
 
stuff
 
covers
 
it
 
up.
 
 
@32:00

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
3.
 
to
 
ask
 
spend
 
time
 
And
 
 
@32:01
 
-
 
Corey
 
Right.
 
Did
 
you
 
even
 
like
 
preview
 
what
 
you
 
put
 
on
 
there?
 
So
 
I
 
sent
 
them
 
in
 
and
 
it
 
said,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
jump
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
today.
 
So
 
I've
 
been
 
a
 
little
 
frustrated
 
with
 
them.
 
That's,
 
that's,
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
clicked
 
on
 
your
 
item
 
there.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
see
 
a
 
clip
 
of
 
the
 
AI
 
component
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
realistic
 
that
 
sounds
 
and
 
everything
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
that's
 
something
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
shave
 
off
 
some
 
money
 
on
 
for
 
the
 
intake
 
service.
 
That
 
they
 
offer.
 
Cause
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
just
 
not
 
getting
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
from
 
them,
 
especially
 
for
 
the
 
cost.
 
Initially
 
they
 
were
 
going
 
to
 
charge
 
me
 
seven
 
50
 
for
 
a
 
per
 
converted
 
lead.
 
And
 
then
 
they
 
moved
 
me
 
to
 
a
 
straight
 
4,000
 
a
 
month.
 
And
 
they
 
said,
 
look,
 
we'll
 
give
 
you
 
two
 
people
 
answering
 
the
 
phones
 
at
 
different
 
hours.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
they'll,
 
they'll
 
book
 
your
 
leads,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
live
 
person.
 
Of
 
course.
 
They're
 
on
 
the
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
okay,
 
I'll
 
try
 
it.
 
And
 
I
 
told
 
him
 
I'd
 
give
 
him,
 
you
 
know,
 
three
 
to
 
four
 
months
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
and
 
see
 
where
 
it
 
ended
 
up.
 
And
 
I've
 
spent
 
more
 
money
 
and
 
have
 
less
 
leads.
 
So
 
I'm
 
not
 
happy
 
with
 
that.
 
So
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
the
 
answering,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
we
 
don't
 
pick
 
up
 
in
 
like
 
two
 
rings
 
or
 
whatever,
 
and
 
AI
 
takes
 
it
 
or
 
whatever,
 
you
 
know,
 
that's
 
something
 
that
 
I'd
 
be
 
interested
 
in
 
doing,
 
for
 
sure.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
at,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
an
 
example
 
ad
 
would
 
look
 
like
 
versus
 
what
 
I
 
sent
 
you.
 
Yeah.
 
You
 
know,
 
I
 
just
 
think
 
it's
 
very
 
plain.
 
And
 
there's
 
not
 
anything
 
on
 
there
 
that
 
would
 
make
 
someone
 
want
 
to
 
click
 
it,
 
you
 
know?

Can
 
I
 
show
 
you
 
something
 
with
 
the
 
scripts?
 
 
@34:00
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yeah.
 
Exactly
 
how
 
the
 
scripts
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
like.
 
Briefly,
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
get
 
up.
 
I'm
 
in
 
the
 
parking
 
area.
 
No
 
problem.
 
My

And
 
so,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
just
 
a
 
second.
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
it

So
 
this
 
is
 
an

OK?
 
And
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
the

OK?
 
The
 
hooks
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
part.
 
So
 
you
 
said
 
you
 
want
 
more
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
from
 
the

OK?
 
OK,
 
so
 
if
 
we
 
have
 
it,
 
do
 
you

my

Do
 
you

you

you
 
wanted
 
more

from

The

So
 
Navy

specifically.
 
 
@34:52

Corey
 
So
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
see
 
here.
 
There's
 
the
 
largest
 
naval
 
base
 
here,
 
you
 
know?
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
target
 
that.
 
 
@34:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
basically,
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
with...
 
With
 
the
 
video
 
ads
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
write
 
you
 
seven
 
different
 
hooks,
 
seven
 
to
 
ten
 
different
 
hooks.
 
Every
 
hook
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
indirectly
 
mention
 
our
 
target
 
audience.
 
Indirectly
 
mention
 
our
 
target
 
audience.
 
And
 
what
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
obviously
 
get
 
the
 
target
 
audience
 
to
 
respond.
 
And
 
then
 
after
 
that,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
the
 
second,
 
like,
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
script
 
here,
 
in
 
which
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
their
 
problems,
 
what
 
they've
 
been
 
facing
 
with,
 
and
 
why
 
they
 
couldn't
 
solve
 
their
 
problems
 
up
 
until
 
now.
 
Then
 
after
 
that,
 
we
 
show
 
them
 
the
 
new
 
possibility,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
either
 
Spravato,
 
Ketamin,
 
TMS,
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
what
 
we
 
advertise.
 
So
 
the
 
ads
 
are
 
tailored,
 
the
 
scripts
 
are
 
tailored
 
towards
 
hating
 
our
 
target
 
audience,
 
but
 
not
 
in
 
a
 
generic,
 
like,
 
honestly,
 
these
 
ads
 
that
 
you
 
showed
 
me,
 
they're
 
generic.
 
They're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
job
 
done,
 
and
 
they're
 
not
 
emotional.
 
They're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
break
 
any
 
beliefs.
 
So
 
our
 
goal
 
with
 
the
 
ads
 
is
 
to
 
break
 
these
 
beliefs
 
and
 
build
 
new
 
beliefs.
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
examples
 
of
 
my
 
client
 
that
 
films
 
these
 
specific
 
video
 
ads.
 
And
 
I
 
also
 
have
 
four
 
more
 
clients
 
that
 
I've
 
been
 
onboarded
 
this
 
week
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
fill
 
Video
 
ads.
 
I
 
wish
 
you
 
would
 
come
 
in
 
a
 
more
 
later
 
stage.
 
I
 
would
 
have
 
even
 
more
 
content
 
to
 
send
 
you,
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
that
 
as
 
a
 
brief
 
example
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
it
 
works.
 
 
@36:11
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yeah.
 
Well,
 
actually
 
with
 
you
 
just
 
started,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
see,
 
you
 
know,
 
cause
 
like
 
I
 
am
 
getting
 
leads
 
right
 
now.
 
 
@36:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
your
 
Bluetooth
 
got
 
disconnected.
 
cannot
 
hear.
 
 
@36:26
 
-
 
Corey
 
Constantly
 
keep,
 
you
 
know,
 
20
 
plus
 
people,
 
um,
 
in
 
the
 
chair.
 
Right.
 
Um,
 
and,
 
um,
 
it's
 
just
 
not,
 
not
 
happening
 
with
 
the
 
current
 
setup.
 
 
@36:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Right.
 
Yeah.
 
And,
 
um,
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
 
@36:42
 
-
 
Corey
 
And
 
I,
 
I'll
 
be
 
hardly
 
hear
 
you.
 
Let's
 
see.
 
 
@36:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what's
 
probably
 
Bluetooth.
 
 
@36:47
 
-
 
Corey
 
There
 
we
 
go.
 
Okay.
 
 
@36:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yep.
 
Yeah.
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
And,
 
um,
 
I
 
know,
 
I
 
know
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
frustrating,
 
honestly,
 
and
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I'm,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent
 
confidence
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
you
 
better
 
results.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
know
 
that.
 
And
 
for
 
that,
 
because
 
you're
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
first
 
clients,
 
and
 
there's
 
also
 
a
 
trust
 
component
 
in
 
here
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
happening,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
offer
 
you
 
a
 
guarantee,
 
a
 
simple
 
guarantee,
 
if
 
we
 
don't
 
get
 
you
 
your
 
desired
 
results,
 
if
 
you're
 
not
 
satisfied
 
with
 
our
 
services,
 
you
 
don't
 
see
 
things
 
changing
 
after
 
a
 
certain
 
time
 
period,
 
say
 
45
 
days,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
refund
 
you
 
the
 
money,
 
man.
 
It's
 
very
 
simple.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
I
 
request
 
from
 
you
 
is
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
see
 
results
 
and
 
you
 
do
 
see
 
a
 
change,
 
you
 
film
 
us
 
a
 
nice
 
testimonial.
 
 
@37:33
 
-
 
Corey
 
So
 
that
 
is
 
basically
 
it.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
my
 
contract
 
on
 
when
 
the
 
Rise
 
4
 
ends,
 
because
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
first
 
one,
 
the
 
first
 
two
 
I
 
think
 
were
 
six
 
months,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
when
 
it
 
ends.
 
So
 
that
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
might
 
have
 
to
 
do,
 
I
 
got
 
a
 
partial
 
type
 
of.
 
I
 
didn't
 
start,
 
you
 
know,
 
until
 
there's
 
like,
 
it's
 
right,
 
because
 
it
 
was
 
like,
 
the
 
first
 
contract
 
was
 
six
 
months,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
was
 
month
 
to
 
month.
 
And
 
then
 
when
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
add
 
on
 
additional
 
services,
 
they
 
wanted
 
me
 
to
 
commit
 
to
 
more.
 
So
 
then
 
they
 
sent
 
a
 
new
 
contract
 
over,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
date
 
that
 
I
 
signed
 
that
 
and
 
what
 
the
 
terms
 
are.
 
 
@38:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
I
 
understand.
 
Sure,
 
man,
 
no
 
problem.
 
We,
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
any
 
contracts.
 
I
 
hate,
 
maybe
 
it's
 
a
 
good
 
business
 
move
 
on
 
their
 
end
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
contract,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
do
 
contracts,
 
man.
 
If
 
you're
 
not
 
happy
 
with
 
my
 
services,
 
I'd
 
just
 
rather
 
let
 
you
 
go
 
and
 
not,
 
you
 
know,
 
have
 
any
 
problem
 
with
 
that.
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
you
 
paying
 
me
 
money
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
see
 
results.
 
It's
 
very
 
simple.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
how
 
we
 
work.
 
Best
 
business
 
move?
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@39:00
 
-
 
Corey
 
All
 
right.
 
 
@39:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
next
 
steps
 
for
 
us
 
is
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
voice
 
AI
 
example.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
landing
 
page
 
example
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@39:10
 
-
 
Corey
 
And
 
the
 
ad
 
example.
 
 
@39:13
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
an
 
ad
 
example
 
of
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
clients.
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
send
 
you
 
our
 
clients'
 
results.
 
I
 
can
 
show
 
you
 
our
 
clients'
 
results
 
in
 
general
 
from
 
all
 
the
 
industries
 
that
 
I'm
 
working
 
in.
 
I
 
can
 
go
 
inside
 
the
 
ads
 
manager.
 
 
@39:26
 
-
 
Corey
 
We
 
have
 
people
 
running
 
on
 
budgets
 
of
 
$600
 
a
 
day,
 
$1,000
 
a
 
day,
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
show
 
you
 
results
 
from
 
different
 
industries
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
see.
 
What
 
is
 
your
 
recommended
 
ad
 
spend
 
to
 
acquire
 
a
 
single
 
TMS
 
patient
 
in
 
California?
 
How
 
much
 
should
 
I
 
be
 
spending
 
on
 
ads?
 
 
@39:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
got
 
last,
 
so
 
you
 
said
 
last
 
month
 
you
 
got
 
seven
 
patients
 
or
 
eight
 
patients
 
for
 
$750?
 
Yeah.
 
Eight
 
patients
 
for
 
$750.
 
 
@39:56
 
-
 
Corey
 
That
 
means
 
you're
 
spending...
 
 
@40:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What
 
are
 
you
 
saying?
 
 
@40:01
 
-
 
Corey
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
was
 
about
 
$750
 
a
 
patient
 
last
 
month
 
on
 
the
 
ads,
 
yeah.
 
 
@40:06
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
you
 
spent
 
$6,400
 
last
 
month.
 
Wait,
 
okay,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
mini
 
problem
 
here.
 
That
 
doesn't
 
make
 
any
 
sense.
 
 
@40:16
 
-
 
Corey
 
If
 
you're
 
paying
 
$4,000
 
a
 
month
 
for
 
the
 
patient
 
coordination.
 
not,
 
I
 
didn't
 
include
 
the
 
intake.
 
 
@40:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
so
 
it's
 
about
 
$750,
 
man.
 
 
@40:25
 
-
 
Corey
 
I
 
didn't
 
include
 
the
 
intake
 
people
 
because
 
I
 
just
 
considered
 
that
 
as
 
salary
 
for
 
another
 
staff
 
member
 
essentially
 
for
 
the
 
month,
 
right?
 
 
@40:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
I
 
understand,
 
okay.
 
 
@40:37
 
-
 
Corey
 
I
 
just
 
treated
 
that
 
as
 
like
 
a
 
TMS
 
tech,
 
know,
 
answering
 
the
 
phone
 
kind
 
of
 
thing.
 
So
 
I
 
didn't
 
include
 
that
 
in
 
the
 
ad.
 
I
 
understand.
 
If
 
I
 
include
 
that,
 
then
 
it's
 
much
 
more,
 
yeah.
 
 
@40:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
our
 
goal,
 
we
 
basically
 
look
 
at
 
it
 
from
 
a
 
CAC
 
to
 
LTV
 
perspective.
 
If
 
you
 
know
 
these
 
two
 
metric
 
or
 
CAC
 
to
 
LTGP.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
our
 
cost
 
back
 
position
 
of
 
a
 
patient
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the...
 
What's
 
it
 
called?
 
The
 
lifetime
 
gross
 
profit
 
from
 
that
 
patient
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
at
 
least
 
10
 
to
 
1.
 
So
 
if
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
is
 
500
 
bucks,
 
we
 
want
 
our
 
lifetime
 
gross
 
profit
 
and
 
gross
 
profit
 
is
 
meaning
 
after
 
what
 
you
 
pay
 
for,
 
like
 
what
 
you
 
get
 
paid
 
in
 
your
 
pocket
 
from
 
the
 
insurance
 
and
 
what
 
you
 
after
 
what
 
you
 
pay
 
for
 
to
 
fulfill
 
the
 
service,
 
meaning
 
the
 
technicians
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
This
 
is
 
our
 
lifetime
 
gross
 
profit.
 
We
 
want
 
that
 
ideally
 
to
 
be
 
10
 
to
 
1,
 
ideally,
 
because
 
if
 
it's
 
10
 
to
 
1,
 
that
 
means
 
we
 
can
 
scale.
 
Yeah.
 
We
 
can
 
scale.
 
And
 
so,
 
yeah,
 
we
 
basically
 
look
 
at
 
what
 
your,
 
you
 
have
 
your
 
current
 
cost
 
per
 
patient,
 
which
 
is
 
750.
 
Then
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
what's
 
your
 
lifetime
 
gross
 
profit.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
that
 
number
 
is.
 
And
 
based
 
on
 
that,
 
we'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
our
 
ad
 
spend
 
is
 
because
 
we
 
can
 
basically
 
spend
 
$10,000
 
a
 
month
 
on
 
ads
 
and
 
make
 
you
 
a
 
monopoly
 
in
 
your
 
area.
 
That
 
is
 
possible.
 
If
 
we
 
do
 
have
 
the
 
systems
 
for
 
that,
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
stats
 
to
 
support,
 
you
 
know,
 
doing
 
that
 
change
 
and
 
getting
 
that
 
rapid
 
scale
 
to
 
get
 
going.
 
It
 
just
 
depends
 
on
 
your
 
business
 
stats.
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
end.
 
If
 
it
 
works,
 
and
 
the
 
CAC-TLTV
 
is
 
10
 
to
 
1,
 
there's
 
no
 
reason
 
to
 
why
 
not
 
just
 
invest,
 
get
 
more
 
money
 
into
 
that
 
machine.
 
It's
 
like
 
a
 
stock.
 
It's
 
like
 
an
 
active
 
stock
 
that
 
is
 
getting
 
you
 
money
 
all
 
the
 
time.
 
So
 
there's
 
no
 
reason
 
why
 
to
 
not
 
invest
 
more
 
money
 
in
 
it.
 
That's
 
how
 
I
 
look
 
at
 
it.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@42:19
 
-
 
Corey
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
Well,
 
let's
 
send
 
those
 
items
 
over,
 
and
 
I'll
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
those
 
videos
 
on
 
my
 
next
 
break
 
here
 
that
 
you
 
sent
 
me
 
on
 
those
 
links.
 
 
@42:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
we'll
 
go
 
from
 
there,
 
okay?
 
Awesome,
 
man.
 
No
 
problem.

Perfect.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
dive
 
straight
 
in.
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
how
 
your
 
dog
 
is
 
doing
 
today.
 
I
 
looked
 
at
 
your
 
form,
 
and
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
it
 
a
 
bit,
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
there,
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
you
 
know,
 
analyze
 
results,
 
help
 
you
 
analyze
 
results,
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
actually
 
help.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
love
 
what
 
you
 
see,
 
and
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
love
 
our
 
dynamic,
 
maybe
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
working
 
together.
 
Sounds
 
good?

Awesome.
 
So
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
bit
 
about
 
what's
 
going
 
on,
 
like
 
dive
 
deeper
 
a
 
bit
 
with
 
the
 
agency.
 
said
 
poor
 
quality
 
leads.
 
You
 
currently
 
have
 
200
 
patients,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
number.
 
So
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
bit
 
about
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
in
 
there.
 
 
@0:55

David

No,
 
I
 
don't

I
 
have
 
 
@1:01
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
history
 
of
 
like
 
a
 
hundred
 
a
 
month,
 
but
 
anyways,
 
I
 
own
 
a
 
pain
 
management
 
company
 
or
 
practice
 
in
 
Seattle.
 
have
 
one
 
in
 
Portland
 
and
 
I'm
 
looking,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
doing
 
these
 
calls
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
see
 
what's
 
out
 
there.
 
I've
 
been
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
marketing
 
company
 
for
 
five
 
years,
 
only
 
doing
 
paid
 
ads
 
with
 
Google,
 
and
 
the
 
spend
 
has
 
been,
 
you
 
know,
 
up
 
to
 
maybe
 
$20,000
 
a
 
month,
 
but
 
they
 
became
 
very,
 
I
 
think,
 
complacent
 
and
 
it
 
became
 
diminishing
 
over
 
time,
 
no
 
social
 
media,
 
no
 
meta.
 
So
 
I
 
started
 
to
 
question
 
that
 
and
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
haven't
 
looked
 
at
 
it
 
too
 
much,
 
to
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
you,
 
I've
 
had
 
other
 
people
 
involved.
 
So
 
now
 
I
 
started
 
looking
 
at
 
it
 
and
 
I
 
realized
 
I
 
just
 
needed
 
a
 
new
 
company.
 
So
 
I
 
signed.
 
I
 
up
 
60
 
almost
 
three
 
months
 
ago
 
with
 
a
 
new
 
firm,
 
and
 
it's
 
the
 
same
 
,
 
it's
 
just
 
not
 
working
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
they
 
said,
 
I
 
mean
 
I've
 
spent
 
the
 
money,
 
and
 
I've
 
been
 
doing
 
this
 
a
 
long
 
time,
 
and
 
the
 
marketing
 
firms
 
that
 
I've
 
used
 
and
 
that
 
I've
 
seen,
 
I've
 
been
 
involved
 
in,
 
when
 
they're
 
not
 
being
 
productive
 
on
 
lead
 
generation,
 
they
 
tend
 
to
 
blame
 
the
 
lead
 
conversion,
 
that's
 
the
 
bottom
 
line,
 
and
 
you
 
know
 
sometimes
 
they're
 
right,
 
and
 
sometimes
 
they're
 
not,
 
but
 
the
 
reality
 
is,
 
qualified
 
leads,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
then
 
being
 
invested
 
in
 
the
 
lead
 
conversion
 
to
 
some
 
degree,
 
is
 
what
 
I'm
 
looking
 
for.
 
I'm
 
looking
 
for
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
leads,
 
I'm
 
looking
 
for
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
qualified
 
leads,
 
I'm
 
looking
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
new
 
patients,
 
and
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
spend
 
the
 
money,
 
but
 
I
 
just
 
literally
 
stopped
 
my
 
marketing
 
yesterday,
 
because
 
I
 
put
 
one
 
of
 
my
 
marketing
 
people
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
that
 
company,
 
showed
 
them
 
the
 
statistics,
 
and
 
we're
 
like
 
money
 
away.
 
Like
 
literally
 
$1,200,
 
$1,300
 
a
 
day
 
for
 
nothing.
 
So
 
we
 
turned
 
off
 
marketing,
 
and
 
here
 
I
 
am
 
looking
 
for
 
other
 
alternatives.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
thank
 
you
 
for
 
sharing
 
all
 
that
 
information.
 
You're
 
going
 
need
 
to
 
execute
 
that
 
information
 
out
 
of
 
people,
 
but
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
you're
 
really
 
in
 
a
 
difficult
 
situation
 
here.
 
What's
 
the
 
company
 
that
 
you're
 
working
 
with?
 
Is
 
that
 
a
 
company
 
that
 
specializes
 
in
 
ketamine
 
with
 
Meta,
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
just
 
a
 
regular
 
marketing
 
firm?
 
 
@3:56
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Yeah,
 
they
 
specialize
 
in
 
ketamine.
 
Ketamine,
 
exactly.
 
Lead
 
generation
 
for
 
ketamine,
 
and
 
yeah.
 
 
@4:06
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What's
 
their
 
name?
 
 
@4:11
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Ketamine
 
Lead
 
Generation
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
 
@4:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
by
 
any
 
chance?
 
 
@4:16
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Maybe.
 
No,
 
no.
 
I'll
 
tell
 
you.
 
 
@4:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
the
 
reason
 
that
 
I'm
 
asking
 
is
 
because
 
you're
 
not
 
the
 
first
 
person
 
that
 
hops
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
me
 
and
 
talks
 
about
 
these
 
things.
 
Actually,
 
I've
 
onboarded
 
a
 
fund.
 
 
@4:33

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Ketamine
 
Lead
 
Gen.
 
Okay,
 
them
 
specifically,
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
know
 
Ketamine
 
Media.
 
But,
 
okay,
 
so
 
you
 
said
 
the
 
statistics
 
were
 
,
 
like
 
$1,200
 
a
 
day
 
is
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
money.
 
Like,
 
what
 
were
 
the
 
statistics
 
there?
 
What
 
types
 
of
 
ad
 
were
 
they
 
running?
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
go,
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
over
 
your
 
ads
 
as
 
well,
 
but
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
dive
 
into
 
the
 
statistics
 
a
 
bit?
 
Talk
 
about
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
in
 
there?
 
 
@4:58
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Yeah,
 
so...
 
Yeah,
 
so...
 
They're
 
running
 
$1,000,
 
let
 
me
 
put
 
it
 
this
 
way,
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
practices,
 
$650
 
a
 
day
 
here,
 
$650
 
a
 
day
 
here,
 
$500
 
on
 
Google,
 
and
 
about
 
$150
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
The
 
people
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
answering
 
the
 
phones,
 
the
 
appointment
 
shutters,
 
they're
 
like,
 
first
 
off,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
leads,
 
they're
 
looking
 
for
 
the
 
wrong
 
clinic,
 
then
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
them,
 
they're
 
like,
 
I
 
didn't
 
fill
 
anything
 
out,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
Facebook
 
leads
 
that
 
are
 
coming
 
in,
 
they're
 
not
 
reachable.
 
So
 
the
 
people
 
fill
 
out
 
a
 
form,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
never
 
reach
 
them,
 
right?
 
So
 
all
 
this,
 
it's
 
just,
 
it's
 
like,
 
hey.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
system
 
that
 
works,
 
and
 
you're
 
not
 
guessing,
 
then
 
show
 
me
 
that,
 
right?
 
So
 
that
 
was
 
the
 
message
 
yesterday,
 
and
 
they
 
started
 
brainstorming.
 
Well,
 
maybe
 
we'll
 
do
 
this,
 
which
 
I'm
 
like,
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
already,
 
based
 
on
 
my
 
stats
 
that
 
I'm
 
showing
 
you,
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
fix
 
this,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
through
 
an
 
experiment
 
with
 
you.
 
So,
 
I
 
have
 
three,
 
four
 
referrals
 
every
 
day
 
in
 
Seattle,
 
because
 
I've
 
been
 
there
 
for
 
12
 
years,
 
right?
 
I
 
want
 
another,
 
I'm
 
only
 
measuring
 
the
 
paid
 
stuff,
 
right?
 
So
 
I
 
like
 
to
 
spend
 
$60
 
or
 
less
 
a
 
lead
 
for
 
a
 
qualified
 
lead.
 
I
 
like
 
to
 
convert
 
one
 
out
 
of
 
two,
 
maybe
 
one
 
out
 
of
 
three,
 
but
 
my
 
costs
 
were
 
booked.
 
Should
 
be
 
under
 
150,
 
and
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
great
 
if
 
it
 
was
 
less,
 
but,
 
and
 
that's
 
a
 
qualified
 
lead
 
booked
 
for,
 
you
 
know,
 
an
 
appointment,
 
meaning
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
condition
 
we
 
can
 
help
 
them
 
with,
 
and
 
there's
 
a
 
method
 
of
 
payment,
 
at
 
least
 
that
 
we
 
source
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
So,
 
of
 
those
 
that
 
we
 
book,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
70%
 
to
 
80%
 
show
 
up,
 
and
 
of
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
show,
 
about
 
two-thirds
 
should
 
buy
 
or
 
convert
 
onto
 
a
 
program
 
of
 
care.
 
That's,
 
that's
 
from
 
30
 
years
 
of
 
experience
 
running
 
clinics,
 
what
 
I
 
just
 
said,
 
so,
 
I'm
 
not,
 
I'm
 
not
 
new
 
to
 
it
 
at
 
all.
 
I've
 
spent
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
$400,000
 
a
 
month
 
in
 
marketing,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
I've,
 
I've
 
spent
 
as
 
little
 
as
 
nothing.
 
So
 
I'll
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
you
 
from
 
a
 
standpoint
 
of
 
like
 
where
 
I
 
am
 
in
 
my
 
kind
 
of
 
appetite
 
for
 
a
 
new
 
marketing
 
firm,
 
they
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
wow
 
me,
 
I'm
 
ready
 
to
 
shut
 
these
 
people
 
down,
 
bring
 
the
 
in
 
office,
 
like
 
in
 
house,
 
hire
 
a
 
marketing
 
director
 
and
 
manager
 
and
 
go,
 
okay,
 
it's
 
on
 
you,
 
buddy,
 
like,
 
hire,
 
somebody
 
go,
 
you're
 
gonna,
 
you're
 
gonna
 
manage
 
all
 
this.
 
Then
 
at
 
least
 
I
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
control,
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
vet
 
that
 
individual,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
paying
 
$6500
 
to
 
this
 
firm
 
per
 
month,
 
$3,250
 
per
 
location.
 
Then
 
you
 
add
 
my
 
marketing
 
spend,
 
then
 
you
 
add,
 
you
 
know,
 
my
 
labor
 
costs
 
within
 
my
 
marketing
 
division.
 
Then
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
other
 
There's
 
a
 
soft
 
cost
 
with
 
it,
 
but
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
making
 
no
 
sense,
 
cost
 
per
 
book,
 
forget
 
about
 
it.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
still
 
searching.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
I
 
understand.
 
So
 
what's
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
now,
 
you
 
know,
 
across
 
both
 
platforms,
 
both
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Google?
 
 
@9:19

David
 
Birdsall
 
It's
 
been
 
as
 
high
 
as
 
$100,
 
but
 
the
 
real
 
problem
 
is
 
the
 
cost
 
booked.
 
Last
 
week,
 
we
 
only
 
booked
 
six
 
new
 
people,
 
and
 
I
 
spent
 
$650
 
times
 
five,
 
so
 
that's
 
like
 
$4,000.
 
Then
 
there's
 
the
 
management
 
fee,
 
but
 
you
 
can't
 
only
 
book
 
six
 
people
 
in
 
a
 
whole
 
week.

That's
 
like
 
a
 
day.
 
Okay,
 
I
 
understand
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
there.
 
I
 
actually
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
your
 
Facebook
 
ads.
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
there.
 
Can
 
you
 
give
 
me
 
your
 
Facebook
 
page?
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you.
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
the

I'm

It's

Yeah,
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
looked
 
up,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
it's
 
this
 
page.
 
It's
 
not
 
this
 
page,
 
right?
 
It
 
doesn't
 
make
 
any
 
sense,
 
like
 
the
 
nine
 
followers,
 
and
 
also
 
there's
 
no
 
ads
 
running
 
here.

It's

new.
 
Oh,
 
okay.
 
Interesting.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
see.
 
Yeah,
 
doesn't
 
show
 
that
 
there's
 
any
 
ads
 
running.
 
Did
 
you
 
stop
 
the

yesterday,

Okay,
 
okay.

understand.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
examples
 
of
 
ads?
 
Did
 
they
 
do
 
the

What
 
types
 
of

do
 
they
 
use?
 
Can
 
you
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
bit?
 
That's
 
another
 
thing.
 
I
 
don't,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
any,
 
I
 
don't

I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
they're
 
running.
 
I
 
don't
 
see,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
anything.
 
Mm-hmm.
 
There
 
go.
 
go.
 
There
 
Yeah,
 
there's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of,
 
like,
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
money
 
that
 
you're
 
spending
 
for
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
bookings
 
is,
 
like,
 
truly
 
is
 
not
 
good.
 
Now,
 
listen,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
and
 
talk
 
about,
 
you
 
know,
 
usually
 
I
 
go
 
and
 
dive
 
deep
 
into
 
the
 
numbers.
 
You
 
know
 
your
 
numbers.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
doing.
 
You're
 
running
 
on
 
high
 
budgets,
 
okay?
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
talking
 
about.
 
Now,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
tell
 
you,
 
did
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
watch
 
any
 
of
 
my
 
videos
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you?
 
I
 
haven't.

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
didn't
 
watch
 
anything.
 
Okay,
 
okay,
 
yeah.
 
The
 
main
 
reason
 
to
 
watch
 
them
 
is
 
because
 
you
 
would
 
come
 
with
 
a
 
bit
 
more,
 
like,
 
with
 
a
 
clear
 
mind
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
exactly
 
we're
 
working,
 
okay?
 
So,
 
the
 
way,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
on
 
a,
 
like,
 
from
 
an
 
ovary
 
right
 
now.
 
The
 
ads
 
that
 
we're
 
running
 
for
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Google,
 
whatever,
 
were
 
they
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
service
 
or
 
just
 
in
 
general
 
to
 
the
 
clinic?
 
Like,
 
were
 
they
 
targeting,
 
for
 
example,
 
specifically
 
Spravato,
 
Spravato,
 
Ketamine,
 
or
 
were
 
they
 
just
 
general
 
ads?
 
going
 
I'm
 
going
 
out.
 
Come
 
to
 
our
 
clinic
 
and
 
see
 
your
 
options,
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
idea?
 
 
@12:06

David
 
Birdsall
 
Good
 
question.
 
I
 
think
 
they've
 
really
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
broken
 
it
 
up
 
into
 
pain
 
management.
 
And
 
then
 
as
 
a
 
general,
 
you
 
know,
 
somebody,
 
somebody
 
is
 
looking
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
take
 
over
 
their
 
medication
 
prescribing,
 
you
 
know,
 
maybe
 
they
 
want
 
an
 
epidural,
 
but
 
then
 
over
 
here,
 
the
 
cash
 
pay
 
stuff,
 
which
 
is
 
like
 
IV
 
ketamine,
 
which
 
is
 
what
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
going.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
there's
 
kind
 
of
 
two
 
campaigns
 
they're
 
running
 
for
 
each
 
location.
 
 
@12:34

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
first
 
thing
 
to
 
say
 
is
 
that
 
when
 
you,
 
again,
 
I
 
don't,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
their
 
ads
 
were,
 
so
 
I
 
cannot
 
give
 
you
 
an
 
assessment
 
on
 
whether
 
they're
 
good
 
or
 
bad.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
give
 
you
 
is
 
examples
 
of
 
what
 
good
 
ads
 
are
 
like.
 
And
 
this
 
video
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
yesterday,
 
you
 
can
 
watch
 
it
 
after
 
this
 
call.
 
I
 
just
 
went
 
and
 
analyzed
 
an
 
entire
 
IV
 
ketamine
 
practice
 
that's
 
doing
 
$100,000
 
a
 
month
 
and
 
explain
 
exactly
 
what
 
they're
 
doing
 
in
 
their
 
funnel
 
and
 
all
 
their
 
marketing.
 
In
 
campaigns,
 
and
 
why
 
it
 
works
 
so
 
well.
 
They
 
have
 
like
 
40
 
ads
 
running
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
and
 
they're
 
really
 
doing
 
it.
 
 
@13:10

David
 
Birdsall
 
Uh-oh,
 
you
 
froze.
 
 
@13:14

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
The
 
same
 
treatment
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
focus.
 
If
 
it's
 
Frobato,
 
IV,
 
Ketamine,
 
TMS,
 
doesn't
 
matter,
 
okay?
 
By
 
the
 
way,
 
can
 
you
 
hear
 
me?
 
Because
 
I
 
see
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
an
 
unstable
 
connection.
 
Is
 
it
 
cool?
 
Yeah.
 
 
@13:28
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Okay.
 
You
 
froze,
 
but
 
now
 
you're
 
back
 
up.
 
 
@13:31

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
first
 
of
 
all...
 
 
@13:33
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Can
 
you
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
company,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
tell
 
me
 
about
 
the
 
service.
 
 
@13:42
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
had
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
see
 
anything
 
about
 
me.
 
My
 
name
 
is
 
Oriel.
 
I've
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
marketing
 
space
 
for
 
five
 
years
 
now,
 
okay?
 
I'm
 
actually
 
from
 
Israel,
 
and
 
I've
 
pivoted
 
to
 
specifically
 
the
 
U.S.
 
market
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
six
 
months,
 
and
 
specifically
 
to
 
the
 
industry
 
of
 
TMS.
 
Ketamine
 
and
 
basically
 
psychedelic
 
treatments
 
because
 
of
 
a
 
simple
 
fact,
 
one
 
of
 
my
 
friends
 
has
 
been
 
on
 
antidepressants
 
for
 
two
 
years
 
since
 
he
 
was
 
19,
 
today
 
he's
 
21,
 
he's
 
not
 
the
 
same
 
person
 
anymore,
 
he's
 
still
 
taking
 
on
 
antidepressants,
 
he's
 
addicted
 
to
 
weed,
 
he's
 
currently
 
in
 
a
 
rehab
 
center,
 
like
 
completely,
 
life
 
completely
 
ruined
 
and
 
he
 
hasn't
 
even
 
started
 
his
 
life,
 
okay.
 
And
 
I
 
myself
 
have
 
an
 
obsession,
 
I
 
guess
 
you
 
could
 
say,
 
quote
 
unquote,
 
with
 
psychedelic
 
medicine
 
and
 
mushrooms
 
specifically.
 
Thing
 
is,
 
it's
 
not
 
very
 
legal
 
yet,
 
only
 
in
 
specific
 
places
 
in
 
the
 
US,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
stumbled
 
across
 
ketamine
 
and
 
I
 
did
 
some
 
research,
 
turns
 
out
 
it's
 
actually
 
legal
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
and
 
it
 
actually
 
has
 
therapeutic
 
benefits.
 
So
 
six
 
months
 
ago
 
I
 
didn't
 
even
 
know
 
that
 
this
 
thing
 
has
 
therapeutic
 
benefits
 
and
 
they're
 
using
 
it
 
to
 
treat
 
mental
 
conditions.
 
So
 
I
 
did
 
research
 
about
 
the
 
market,
 
about
 
what's
 
going
 
on,
 
competitors,
 
clinics,
 
and
 
I've
 
seen
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
opportunity.
 
Because
 
in
 
Israel,
 
you
 
cannot
 
choose
 
who
 
to
 
work
 
with.
 
I
 
can
 
have
 
12
 
clients
 
in
 
Israel
 
that
 
I
 
work
 
with.
 
Every
 
single
 
one
 
of
 
them
 
is
 
in
 
a
 
different
 
industry.
 
Every
 
single
 
one.
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
to
 
get
 
results,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
marketing
 
at
 
its
 
core.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
psychological
 
principles,
 
direct
 
response.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
any
 
of
 
these
 
big
 
copywriters
 
or
 
marketers
 
from
 
like
 
big
 
marketers.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
marketing.
 
And
 
I've
 
done
 
research,
 
seen
 
the
 
companies
 
that
 
do
 
marketing
 
for
 
your
 
types
 
of
 
clinics,
 
and
 
they're
 
doing
 
a
 
job.
 
They're
 
doing
 
a
 
very
 
job.
 
And
 
I
 
explained
 
in
 
my
 
videos
 
exactly
 
why
 
and
 
why
 
what
 
they're
 
doing
 
is
 
not
 
working
 
and
 
what
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
you
 
do
 
need
 
to
 
create.
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
dive
 
into
 
that
 
now.
 
But
 
basically,
 
I'm
 
creating
 
direct
 
response-based
 
ads.
 
And
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we're
 
doing
 
this
 
is
 
by
 
creating
 
beliefs
 
in
 
the
 
patients,
 
creating
 
a
 
belief.
 
Because
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
specifically
 
for
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
dealing
 
with
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression,
 
whether
 
we
 
advertise
 
ketamine,
 
TMS,
 
or
 
spravato,
 
or
 
even
 
psychedelic
 
therapy.
 
The
 
main
 
problem
 
that
 
these
 
people
 
have
 
is
 
belief,
 
belief
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
heal,
 
because
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
labeled
 
as
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
has
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression,
 
you
 
believe
 
that
 
you
 
cannot
 
heal.
 
So
 
if
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
break
 
that
 
belief
 
with
 
our
 
advertising,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
what
 
we
 
do,
 
they're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
convert,
 
or
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
leads
 
that
 
are
 
poor
 
quality
 
and
 
don't
 
pick
 
up
 
the
 
phone
 
as
 
you
 
have
 
right
 
now
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
cost-provoking
 
of
 
God
 
knows
 
how
 
much,
 
$700
 
without
 
the
 
marketing
 
fee
 
that
 
you're
 
paying
 
to
 
people.
 
So
 
what
 
we're
 
doing
 
with
 
our
 
ads
 
is
 
breaking
 
these
 
beliefs
 
and
 
creating
 
new
 
beliefs
 
of
 
making
 
them
 
feel
 
like
 
they
 
can
 
heal.
 
And
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
do
 
that?
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
use
 
stock
 
photos.
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
use
 
the
 
images
 
of
 
an
 
IV
 
ketamine
 
machine.
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
design
 
ads.
 
We
 
use
 
video
 
ads
 
specifically.
 
Video
 
ads,
 
we
 
write
 
scripts
 
to
 
every
 
single
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
clients.
 
We
 
test
 
out
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
ads
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
by
 
using
 
different
 
hooks
 
for
 
every
 
single
 
ad,
 
okay?
 
So
 
So
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
a
 
hook
 
is?
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
the
 
format
 
of
 
all
 
these
 
things?
 
So
 
we're
 
testing,
 
for
 
example,
 
10
 
different
 
hooks
 
with
 
one
 
body
 
ad
 
copy.
 
We
 
put
 
that
 
onto
 
Facebook
 
and
 
that's
 
one
 
angle.
 
Okay,
 
one
 
body
 
copy
 
is
 
one
 
angle.
 
So
 
an
 
angle
 
could
 
be
 
an
 
educative
 
angle.
 
Another
 
angle
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
use
 
is
 
a
 
story-based
 
angle.
 
If
 
it's
 
one
 
of
 
your
 
stories,
 
one
 
of
 
your
 
patient's
 
stories,
 
and
 
if
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
testimonial,
 
we
 
can
 
basically
 
take
 
the
 
entire
 
process
 
that
 
a
 
patient
 
has
 
been
 
through,
 
create
 
that
 
and
 
turn
 
that
 
into
 
an
 
ad.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
ad
 
that
 
works
 
the
 
best
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
it
 
makes
 
people
 
believe
 
that
 
if
 
another
 
person
 
healed,
 
they
 
can
 
also
 
heal.
 
Okay?
 
And
 
especially
 
with
 
high
 
budgets
 
like
 
yours,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
always
 
have
 
a
 
new
 
flow
 
of
 
ads.
 
Another
 
thing
 
is
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
they
 
sign
 
up.
 
Okay?
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
use
 
Facebook
 
lead
 
forms
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
sign
 
up.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
landing
 
page
 
which
 
creates
 
friction
 
and
 
qualifies
 
the
 
leads
 
before
 
they
 
even
 
leave
 
their
 
details.
 
Okay?
 
Okay?
 
Another
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
do
 
is
 
we
 
use,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
fast
 
your
 
team
 
calls
 
the
 
leads,
 
but
 
we
 
are
 
deploying
 
a
 
voice
 
AI
 
agent
 
that
 
calls
 
leads
 
within
 
five
 
minutes
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
high
 
pickup
 
rate,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
basically
 
doing
 
the
 
discovery
 
process
 
in
 
that
 
call
 
to
 
understand
 
what
 
they've
 
been
 
going
 
through,
 
how
 
many
 
medications
 
they
 
took,
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
things,
 
and
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
ideally
 
book
 
them
 
into
 
a
 
consultation
 
in
 
the
 
clinic.
 
And
 
the
 
last
 
thing
 
is,
 
as
 
you've
 
said,
 
the
 
show-up
 
rate,
 
okay?
 
We
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
people
 
cannot
 
be
 
booked
 
more
 
than
 
three
 
days
 
ahead,
 
because
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
booked
 
more
 
than
 
three
 
days
 
ahead,
 
that
 
creates
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
friction,
 
and
 
people,
 
especially
 
with
 
depression,
 
if
 
we're
 
talking
 
about
 
IV
 
ketamine,
 
are
 
less
 
inclined
 
to
 
show
 
up
 
if
 
you
 
book
 
them
 
more
 
than
 
five
 
days
 
ahead.
 
It's
 
just
 
statistics.
 
We
 
talked
 
about
 
the
 
statistic,
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
it
 
works,
 
okay?
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
basically,
 
in
 
a
 
nutshell,
 
the
 
entire
 
process.
 
So
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
use
 
stock
 
photos,
 
we
 
use
 
educative
 
ads,
 
use
 
video
 
ads,
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
we
 
edit
 
the
 
ads,
 
we
 
do
 
everything,
 
you
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
film
 
them
 
or
 
somebody
 
from
 
your
 
team.
 
And
 
we...
 
We
 
We
 
test
 
a
 
ton
 
every
 
two
 
weeks.
 
We
 
go
 
in,
 
optimize,
 
see
 
what
 
our
 
bottlenecks
 
are,
 
and
 
improve.
 
Very
 
simple.
 
Like,
 
I
 
cannot
 
put
 
it
 
in
 
a
 
more
 
simple
 
way.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@19:14
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So
 
our
 
job
 
is
 
still
 
the
 
lead
 
conversion.
 
The
 
lead
 
comes
 
in
 
by
 
a
 
phone
 
call
 
or
 
a
 
form,
 
or
 
how
 
does
 
the
 
lead
 
hit
 
my
 
team?
 
 
@19:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
use
 
GoHighLevel?
 
 
@19:28
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
this
 
platform
 
is
 
by
 
any
 
chance?
 
Yeah,
 
we're
 
about
 
to.
 
 
@19:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
been
 
on
 
my
 
list
 
to
 
convert
 
to
 
that,
 
but
 
yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
we
 
use
 
GoHighLevel
 
for
 
basically
 
everything.
 
Automations,
 
handling
 
the
 
lead
 
pipeline,
 
creating
 
the
 
landing
 
pages
 
there.
 
Everything
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
this
 
platform
 
because
 
it's
 
just
 
extremely
 
efficient
 
and
 
it's
 
so
 
simple
 
for
 
your
 
team.
 
And
 
also,
 
you
 
don't
 
pay
 
any
 
money
 
for
 
it
 
because
 
if
 
you're
 
under
 
my
 
account,
 
you
 
don't
 
pay
 
anything.
 
That
 
being
 
said,
 
the
 
account
 
is
 
still
 
under
 
your
 
control.
 
Meaning
 
if.
 
If
 
you
 
wish
 
to
 
leave,
 
you
 
can
 
actually
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
GoHighLevel
 
account,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
transfer
 
the
 
subaccount
 
there.
 
That's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
agencies
 
will
 
not
 
tell
 
you,
 
by
 
the
 
way.
 
They're
 
going
 
to
 
try
 
and
 
keep
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
contract.
 
So
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
know
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
we
 
basically
 
use
 
GoHighLevel
 
for
 
everything.
 
We
 
train
 
your
 
team
 
on
 
it.
 
We
 
add
 
everybody
 
there.
 
If
 
we
 
need,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
call
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
things
 
that
 
they
 
have,
 
any
 
questions,
 
any
 
help
 
that
 
they
 
need.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
You
 
know,
 
we
 
use
 
GoHighLevel.
 
That's
 
what
 
we
 
use
 
for
 
all
 
clients.

I'm
 
in

David

Wow.
 
 
@20:36
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What
 
time
 
is
 
it
 
there?
 
It's
 
9,
 
9
 
p.m.
 
I'm
 
starting
 
to
 
work
 
now.
 
No,
 
I'm
 
just
 
kidding.
 
But
 
I
 
have,
 
this
 
is
 
like,
 
these
 
are
 
my
 
hours.
 
 
@20:48
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So
 
you
 
work
 
all
 
night?
 
 
@20:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
I
 
don't
 
work
 
all
 
night.
 
I
 
usually
 
communicate
 
with
 
clients
 
and
 
take
 
calls
 
in
 
the
 
morning
 
until
 
early
 
evening.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
stop
 
Oregon
 
at
 
like
 
10.
 
Approximately.
 
And
 
just
 
make
 
sure.
 
We
 
that
 
everything
 
is
 
handled
 
if
 
there
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
the
 
client,
 
it
 
happens
 
in
 
the
 
morning,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
actions
 
to
 
take,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
everything
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
days.
 
How
 
long
 
have
 
you,
 
you
 
said
 
you've
 
been
 
in
 
marketing
 
for
 
five
 
years.
 
 
@21:14
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
correct.
 
But
 
the
 
clinics
 
like
 
this,
 
the
 
last
 
six
 
months?
 
 
@21:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
 
@21:21
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
How
 
many
 
clients
 
do
 
you
 
have?
 
 
@21:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
just
 
this
 
week
 
onboarded
 
four
 
new
 
clients.
 
Currently,
 
I
 
am
 
consulting
 
for
 
Greenbrook
 
TMS,
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
who
 
these
 
guys
 
are.
 
You
 
can
 
do
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
research
 
about
 
them.
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
another
 
clinic
 
that
 
is
 
currently
 
active
 
in
 
Arkansas.
 
We
 
have
 
four
 
clients
 
in
 
onboarding
 
right
 
now.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
this
 
is
 
mainly
 
that.
 
 
@21:42
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So
 
we
 
would
 
be
 
just
 
beginning,
 
like
 
you're
 
just
 
beginning
 
to
 
start.
 
 
@21:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
understand.
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
But
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
with
 
my
 
marketing
 
experience
 
in
 
Israel,
 
in
 
Israel,
 
I
 
currently
 
have
 
12
 
clients.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
it's
 
not
 
about
 
the
 
industry
 
itself,
 
because
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
industry.
 
From
 
the
 
inside
 
out
 
already.
 
Okay.
 
I've
 
talked
 
with
 
over
 
30
 
to
 
40
 
clinic
 
owners.
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
marketing
 
agencies
 
do.
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
services
 
are.
 
I
 
know
 
it
 
from
 
a
 
very
 
close
 
place
 
as
 
well,
 
because
 
I've
 
done
 
research
 
on
 
psychedelics
 
and
 
treating
 
mental
 
conditions
 
without,
 
without
 
like
 
even
 
any
 
relation
 
to
 
the
 
agency
 
itself.
 
So
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
you
 
can
 
say
 
that
 
I'm
 
beginning
 
technically,
 
but
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
industry
 
from
 
the
 
inside
 
out.
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
people
 
are
 
going
 
through.
 
And
 
because
 
I
 
know
 
that,
 
and
 
I
 
know
 
marketing.
 
 
@22:29
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
I
 
don't,
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
bad
 
thing.
 
 
@22:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
know.
 
It's
 
just,
 
it
 
is,
 
it
 
is,
 
it
 
is
 
kind
 
of
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
Oh,
 
you're
 
beginning.
 
 
@22:37
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
It's
 
like,
 
it
 
feels
 
like,
 
Oh
 
.
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
become
 
defensive
 
a
 
little
 
bit.
 
But
 
I
 
understand.
 
Everybody's
 
got
 
to
 
start
 
somewhere,
 
right?
 
 
@22:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
And,
 
um,
 
yeah,
 
the
 
agency
 
in
 
Israel
 
gave
 
me.
 
 
@22:49
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
What's
 
the
 
cost
 
and
 
what's
 
all
 
included?
 
 
@22:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
two
 
models.
 
Okay.
 
We
 
have
 
one
 
that
 
is
 
one
 
model
 
that
 
is
 
more
 
pay
 
per
 
performance.
 
And
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
is
 
more.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
our
 
retainers
 
currently
 
are
 
way
 
lower
 
and
 
then
 
what
 
other
 
people
 
charge
 
a
 
hundred
 
like
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
retainer
 
of
 
$2,000
 
a
 
month
 
and
 
which
 
is
 
only
 
a
 
flat
 
retainer
 
or
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
performance-based
 
model
 
which
 
cuts
 
the
 
retainer
 
in
 
half
 
but
 
we
 
get
 
paid
 
$100
 
for
 
every
 
appointment
 
booked
 
if
 
the
 
opponent
 
doesn't
 
show
 
up
 
it's
 
half
 
of
 
that
 
and
 
to
 
start
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
campaigns
 
we
 
have
 
$1,000
 
setup
 
fee
 
to
 
create
 
all
 
the
 
assets
 
within
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
these
 
things
 
and
 
you
 
know
 
do
 
the
 
onboarding
 
calls
 
and
 
you
 
know
 
pay
 
my
 
team
 
to
 
do
 
all
 
the
 
technical
 
stuff
 
as
 
well
 
in
 
the
 
back
 
end
 
and
 
yeah
 
we
 
also
 
have
 
a
 
satisfaction
 
guarantee
 
basically
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
happy
 
okay
 
with
 
our
 
services
 
within
 
the
 
first
 
30
 
days
 
you
 
can
 
just
 
get
 
your
 
money
 
back
 
and
 
that's
 
basically
 
it
 
you
 
know
 
we
 
set
 
a
 
KPI
 
you
 
see
 
how
 
we
 
work
 
together
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
dynamic
 
perfect
 
we
 
don't
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
refund
 
you
 
the
 
money
 
cutting
 
like
 
besides
 
the
 
setup
 
fee
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
thing
 
you
 
know
 
we
 
do
 
it
 
doesn't
 
have
 
have
 
a
 
 
@24:04
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
How
 
long
 
does
 
it
 
take
 
to
 
onboard
 
and
 
begin
 
getting
 
leads?
 
 
@24:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
The
 
campaigns
 
are
 
ideally
 
live
 
between
 
7
 
to
 
10
 
days.
 
It
 
also
 
depends
 
on
 
you,
 
though,
 
and
 
how
 
fast
 
are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
film
 
the
 
videos,
 
and
 
how
 
fast
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
us
 
content,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
testimonials,
 
all
 
these
 
things,
 
because
 
we
 
can
 
create
 
static
 
ads.
 
We
 
can't
 
create
 
image
 
ads
 
and
 
do
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I'm
 
less
 
of
 
a
 
fan.
 
These
 
ads
 
do
 
work,
 
but
 
I'd
 
rather
 
push
 
video
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
game
 
of
 
two
 
here.
 
No,
 
it's
 
me
 
and
 
you.
 
But
 
ideally
 
7
 
to
 
10
 
days.
 
 
@24:40
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
need
 
just
 
a
 
phone,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
need
 
something
 
like
 
a
 
better
 
camera?
 
 
@24:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
no.
 
A
 
phone
 
works.
 
A
 
phone
 
works.
 
We
 
also,
 
in
 
our
 
online
 
process,
 
I
 
have
 
an
 
entire
 
video
 
showing
 
how
 
to
 
film
 
video
 
ads
 
with
 
examples,
 
and
 
is
 
there
 
an
 
entire
 
SOP
 
on
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@24:57
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So.
 
So
 
are
 
you,
 
is
 
Mo,
 
and
 
then
 
what.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
recommend
 
for
 
a
 
spend?
 
Like
 
if
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
10
 
booked
 
in
 
each
 
location,
 
20
 
a
 
day,
 
100,
 
you
 
know,
 
100
 
a
 
week
 
booked,
 
how
 
would
 
you
 
go,
 
how
 
would
 
you
 
do
 
that?

Mm-hmm.
 
That's
 
a
 
great
 
question.
 
And
 
honestly,
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
your
 
area,
 
I
 
haven't
 
done
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
research
 
on
 
your
 
area,
 
and
 
I
 
haven't
 
seen
 
your
 
ads,
 
I
 
cannot
 
gauge
 
the
 
exact
 
budget,
 
but
 
we
 
can
 
put
 
KPIs.
 
That's
 
the
 
main
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
put.
 
You
 
said
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
a
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
below
 
150.
 
Our
 
ideal
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
is,
 
what
 
is
 
your
 
ideal
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
for
 
you?
 
Like
 
what's
 
the
 
best
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
that
 
you're
 
looking
 
for?
 
$50,
 
for
 
example,
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
something?
 
 
@25:51

David
 
Birdsall
 
But
 
would
 
you
 
use
 
Google?
 
Would
 
you
 
use
 
Facebook?
 
 
@25:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Would
 
you
 
use
 
Instagram?
 
What
 
would
 
you
 
use?
 
So
 
that's
 
a
 
perfect,
 
that's
 
very
 
good
 
because
 
Google
 
specifically.
 
Specifically,
 
I
 
hate
 
Google,
 
and
 
not
 
because
 
we
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
them,
 
but
 
because
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
click
 
fraud
 
there.
 
In
 
fact,
 
Greenbrook
 
TMS,
 
the
 
client
 
that
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
to,
 
they
 
are
 
in
 
a
 
huge
 
lawsuit
 
with
 
Google,
 
because
 
a
 
third
 
of
 
their
 
clicks
 
were
 
click
 
fraud,
 
and
 
they're
 
running
 
on
 
$150,000
 
a
 
month
 
budget.
 
They're
 
advertising
 
to
 
the
 
entire
 
U.S.
 
They
 
have
 
120
 
clinics
 
across
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
and
 
they're
 
suing
 
them.
 
I
 
love
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Instagram
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
they're
 
interrupted-based
 
ads,
 
so
 
it
 
opens
 
up
 
a
 
new
 
market
 
for
 
you,
 
because
 
on
 
Google,
 
people
 
search
 
up
 
for
 
specific
 
services.
 
On
 
Facebook,
 
people
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
offer,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
come
 
in
 
and
 
educate
 
them,
 
you
 
basically
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
eyeballs
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
on
 
Google.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
YouTube
 
as
 
well,
 
which
 
is
 
also
 
from
 
Google,
 
but
 
I
 
like
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Instagram
 
because
 
that's
 
my
 
strong
 
suit.
 
The
 
creative
 
side
 
is
 
my
 
strong
 
suit,
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
copywriting
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
we
 
can
 
use
 
Google.
 
Basically,
 
I
 
use
 
Google
 
mainly
 
for
 
branding,
 
branding
 
campaigns.
 
So
 
if
 
a
 
person
 
sees
 
the
 
ads,
 
searches
 
up
 
for
 
your
 
clinic,
 
we
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
sponsored
 
on
 
top.
 
We
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
Google
 
in
 
general.
 
We
 
can
 
use
 
Google.
 
We
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
them.
 
It's
 
very
 
easy
 
in
 
a
 
local
 
area,
 
but
 
I
 
just,
 
I,
 
if
 
anything,
 
I
 
would
 
move
 
more
 
of
 
the
 
budget
 
to
 
Facebook.
 
If
 
you
 
do
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
Google,
 
we
 
just
 
lower
 
the
 
budgets
 
there
 
because
 
they
 
do
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
click
 
fraud.
 
 
@27:28
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
I
 
know.
 
I'm
 
not
 
qualified
 
to.
 
 
@27:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
want.
 
No,
 
you
 
are.
 
You
 
are.
 
You
 
have
 
a
 
lot.
 
You
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
experience,
 
man.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
You
 
spent
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
money.
 
 
@27:37
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Well,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
pay
 
somebody
 
to
 
generate
 
the
 
leads
 
and
 
not,
 
see,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
people
 
tend
 
to
 
do.
 
This
 
is
 
what
 
this
 
new
 
firm
 
does.
 
It's
 
not
 
working.
 
And
 
then
 
they
 
asked
 
me
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do.
 
And
 
I'm
 
like,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
You're
 
the
 
expert.
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
bought.
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
paid
 
for
 
you.
 
 
@28:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Right.
 
Right.
 
 
@28:00
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So
 
I
 
have,
 
if
 
it
 
should
 
all
 
be
 
on
 
Facebook,
 
okay.
 
If
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
only
 
20%
 
on
 
Google,
 
okay.
 
Like,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I've
 
been
 
paying
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
money
 
to
 
Google,
 
like
 
a
 
thousand
 
a
 
day,
 
and
 
nothing's
 
happening.
 
 
@28:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Uh
 
huh.
 
Yeah.
 
Okay.
 
Then
 
that's
 
the
 
strategy.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
move
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
budget
 
to
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Instagram,
 
because
 
there's
 
way
 
more
 
eyeballs
 
there.
 
And
 
with
 
your
 
budget,
 
you
 
can
 
basically
 
monopolize
 
your
 
area
 
with
 
good
 
ads.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
many
 
competitors
 
you
 
have
 
in
 
your
 
area.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
search
 
that
 
up,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
basically
 
monopolize
 
your
 
area
 
with
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
budget
 
that
 
you
 
have,
 
because
 
most
 
clinics
 
that
 
we
 
work
 
with
 
run
 
on
 
$50
 
a
 
day
 
budgets.
 
Like
 
also
 
my,
 
like
 
the
 
highest
 
budgets
 
that
 
I'm
 
running
 
in
 
Israel
 
currently
 
is
 
a
 
thousand
 
dollars
 
a
 
day.
 
Like
 
people
 
don't
 
usually
 
use
 
these
 
budgets,
 
especially
 
in
 
a
 
local
 
area.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
advantage
 
here
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
spend,
 
like
 
spend
 
power.
 
 
@28:58
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So
 
your
 
biggest
 
client
 
is
 
green.
 
 
@29:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes.
 
And
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
to
 
them.
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
I'm
 
not
 
running
 
the
 
ads.
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
them
 
on
 
what
 
to
 
do,
 
what
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
to
 
write,
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
current
 
content
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
most
 
out
 
of
 
it,
 
and
 
also
 
optimizing
 
the
 
entire
 
marketing
 
funnel
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@29:16
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
So
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
correct.
 
When
 
start
 
with
 
that?
 
 
@29:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Two
 
months
 
ago.
 
 
@29:25
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
They
 
have
 
120
 
clinics?
 
 
@29:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
We
 
don't
 
dive,
 
because
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
their
 
campaigns,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
how
 
campaigns
 
on
 
Facebook
 
work,
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
basically
 
advertise
 
to
 
the
 
entire
 
nation.
 
they
 
have
 
one
 
website
 
in
 
which
 
they
 
use
 
for
 
all
 
clinics,
 
and
 
you
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
put
 
your
 
zip
 
code
 
inside,
 
and
 
it
 
matches
 
the
 
area
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
and
 
finds
 
the
 
clinic
 
closest
 
to
 
you.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
 
@29:50
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
All
 
right.
 
So
 
you
 
said
 
it's
 
$2,000
 
retainer,
 
$1,000.
 
$1,000
 
up
 
front,
 
plus
 
obviously
 
my
 
spend,
 
or
 
$100
 
per
 
show,
 
and
 
if
 
they
 
don't
 
show,
 
it's
 
$50?
 
 
@30:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
and
 
the
 
retainer
 
is
 
cut
 
in
 
half,
 
so
 
it's
 
$1,000
 
retainer,
 
not
 
$2,000.
 
We
 
basically
 
are
 
incentivized
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
performance,
 
which
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
way
 
more
 
profitable
 
to
 
us.
 
Especially
 
with
 
your
 
budget,
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
to
 
an
 
$8,000
 
retainer.
 
If
 
you
 
don't
 
care,
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
performance,
 
great.
 
I'm
 
all
 
up
 
for
 
it,
 
man.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
care.
 
 
@30:38
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
anybody
 
that
 
signed
 
up
 
for
 
this
 
performance
 
space,
 
or
 
does
 
everybody
 
do
 
the
 
retainer?
 
 
@30:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
people
 
do
 
tend
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
retainer.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
actually
 
thought
 
that
 
way
 
more
 
people
 
would
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
performance
 
model,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
most
 
people
 
sign
 
on
 
retainers,
 
because
 
the
 
thought
 
of
 
needing
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
To
 
pay
 
more,
 
it's
 
just
 
a
 
psychological
 
need,
 
I
 
believe,
 
to
 
want
 
stability,
 
I
 
guess.
 
Not
 
exactly
 
what
 
you're
 
paying
 
for.
 
Even
 
though
 
it
 
doesn't
 
make
 
any
 
sense
 
because
 
if
 
a
 
person
 
shows
 
up
 
and
 
he
 
closes
 
on
 
an
 
$8,000
 
treatment,
 
it's
 
just
 
$100
 
is
 
not
 
very
 
much,
 
you
 
know?
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
But
 
everybody
 
has
 
their
 
own
 
preferences.
 
 
@31:22
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Well,
 
what
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
cautious
 
of
 
is
 
what
 
if
 
we're
 
not
 
good
 
at
 
booking
 
them?
 
 
@31:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
good
 
at
 
booking
 
them
 
because
 
you
 
said
 
that
 
you
 
had
 
30
 
years
 
of
 
experience.
 
I
 
believe
 
you
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
train
 
your
 
team.
 
 
@31:36
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
all
 
this
 
in
 
an
 
email?
 
I'm
 
sure
 
you
 
do
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
then
 
think
 
about
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
a
 
follow
 
up
 
call
 
where
 
I'll
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
I
 
said.
 
 
@31:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
Yeah,
 
this
 
call
 
is
 
being
 
transcripted
 
and
 
everything.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
send
 
the
 
summary
 
of
 
this
 
call.
 
By
 
the
 
way,
 
I'm
 
using
 
ChatGPT
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
know.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@31:56
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
Send
 
me
 
that
 
and
 
then...
 
I'm
 
sure
 
I'll
 
have
 
questions.
 
 
@32:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
it.
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
There's
 
no
 
problem.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
summary.
 
Yeah,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
I
 
do
 
encourage
 
you
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
go
 
over
 
our
 
Instagram
 
and
 
YouTube,
 
watch
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
the
 
videos,
 
understand
 
how
 
we
 
work.
 
Because
 
I
 
did
 
explain
 
to
 
you,
 
but
 
the
 
videos
 
dive
 
deeper.
 
So
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
more
 
clarity.
 
Maybe
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
also
 
pop
 
up
 
more
 
questions
 
to
 
you
 
based
 
on
 
these
 
videos,
 
which
 
is
 
also
 
important.
 
Because
 
I
 
do
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
make
 
this
 
decision,
 
you
 
know,
 
100%
 
with
 
trust
 
in
 
me.
 
 
@32:30
 
-
 
David
 
Birdsall
 
The
 
video.
 
That's
 
great.
 
 
@32:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
Yeah.
 
Watch
 
the,
 
the
 
ketamine,
 
watch
 
the
 
video
 
of
 
me
 
analyzing
 
the
 
ketamine
 
marketing,
 
the
 
ketamine
 
clinic.
 
That's
 
a,
 
that's
 
a
 
good
 
video.
 
It
 
is.
 
Sorry
 
for
 
the
 
word,
 
but
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
video.
 
Like
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
video.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
summary.
 
You
 
let
 
me
 
know
 
when
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
second
 
call.
 
Like,
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
touch
 
base
 
with
 
you
 
on
 
Friday
 
or
 
next
 
week?
 
 
@32:55

David

How
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do

but
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
week.
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
No
 
problem.
 
Another
 
thing.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
any
 
problem
 
filming
 
videos,
 
correct?
 
You
 
or
 
somebody
 
from
 
your
 
team,
 
I
 
don't
 
care,
 
but
 
we
 
do...
 
 
@33:18

David
 
Birdsall
 
I
 
have
 
to.
 
I'll
 
have
 
somebody
 
on
 
my
 
team
 
do
 
it,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
it.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
great.
 
Because
 
we
 
do
 
need
 
somebody
 
to
 
film
 
the
 
videos.
 
We
 
can
 
also
 
pay
 
a
 
UGC
 
creator,
 
but
 
who
 
would
 
want
 
to
 
pay
 
like
 
$500
 
to
 
a
 
creator
 
to
 
just
 
get
 
ads
 
going
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
somebody
 
from
 
your
 
team
 
to
 
do
 
it?
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
a
 
reason
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
So,
 
yeah.

I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
straight.
 
 
@0:15

I'm

I'm
 
going
 
to
 
dive
 
straight
 
in.
 
Did
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
watch
 
the
 
videos
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you?
 
 
@0:22
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
I
 
happened
 
to
 
have
 
to.
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
work
 
last
 
night
 
overnight,
 
so
 
I
 
was
 
trying.
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
went
 
in
 
between
 
and
 
I
 
didn't
 
really.
 
But
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
looked
 
at
 
it
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
this
 
morning.
 
The
 
first
 
one
 
I
 
looked
 
at,
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
was
 
like
 
in
 
a
 
park
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
the
 
second,
 
the
 
other
 
two
 
videos,
 
like
 
the
 
YouTube
 
videos,
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
skimmed
 
through
 
the
 
both
 
of
 
them
 
pretty
 
much
 
with
 
the
 
touch
 
on
 
the
 
pain
 
needs
 
and
 
stuff
 
like
 
that.
 
But
 
I
 
didn't
 
really
 
go
 
too
 
deep
 
in
 
it.

But
 
I
 
did
 
click
 
on
 
it
 
this
 
morning.
 
Okay.
 
Thank
 
you
 
for
 
looking.
 
That's
 
important.
 
Okay.
 
There's
 
people
 
that
 
don't
 
even
 
look
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
hop
 
on
 
the
 
call
 
like,
 
what
 
are
 
you
 
doing?
 
So,
 
thank
 
you
 
for
 
looking.
 
So,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
dive
 
in
 
straight
 
and
 
tell
 
you.
 
Are
 
you
 
the
 
first
 
marketing
 
partner
 
that
 
you're
 
talking
 
to?
 
Have
 
you
 
talked
 
to
 
other
 
people?
 
Have
 
you
 
worked
 
with
 
other
 
agencies
 
in
 
past?
 
 
@1:07
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Never.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
actually,
 
because
 
I
 
currently
 
have
 
a
 
partnership
 
with
 
another
 
nurse
 
practitioner.
 
And
 
she
 
decided
 
to
 
say
 
that
 
she
 
doesn't
 
want
 
to
 
scale
 
the
 
practice
 
anymore.
 
She
 
doesn't
 
see
 
herself
 
doing
 
this.
 
And
 
it's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
hard
 
work
 
that
 
she
 
anticipated.
 
And
 
I
 
just
 
said,
 
OK,
 
so
 
I
 
know
 
we
 
were
 
offering
 
ketamine
 
within
 
our
 
private
 
practice,
 
but
 
I
 
never
 
really
 
pushed
 
it
 
because,
 
again,
 
I
 
see
 
treating
 
diagnosed.
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
patience.
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
time.
 
And
 
she's
 
like,
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
scale
 
it.
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
this.
 
We
 
have
 
to
 
drop
 
off
 
brochures,
 
do
 
IG.
 
I'm
 
like,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
just
 
pay
 
someone
 
to
 
help
 
me
 
market
 
this
 
ketamine.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
I
 
mean?
 
And
 
she's
 
like,
 
no,
 
that's
 
a
 
waste
 
of
 
money.
 
And
 
she's
 
very
 
into
 
Instagram,
 
social
 
media.
 
She's
 
into
 
all.
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
time.
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
that
 
type
 
of
 
time.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
I
 
just
 
don't.
 
So
 
I
 
said,
 
OK,
 
no
 
problem.
 
So
 
she
 
said,
 
we
 
know
 
what
 
lets
 
you
 
just
 
push
 
ketamine
 
by
 
yourself
 
solely.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
I
 
mean?
 
Don't
 
think
 
so
 
I
 
started
 
building
 
up
 
a
 
whole
 
new.
 
I
 
LLC
 
and
 
have
 
my
 
own
 
clinic
 
that's
 
just
 
doing
 
ketamine
 
and
 
she's
 
gonna
 
eventually
 
do
 
her
 
own
 
thing
 
so
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
actually
 
like
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
someone
 
help
 
me
 
with
 
this
 
whole
 
ketamine
 
not
 
the
 
whole
 
thing
 
about
 
it
 
yeah
 
pretty
 
much
 
okay
 
and
 
do
 
you
 
offer
 
is
 
it
 
cash
 
pay
 
ketamine
 
do
 
you
 
offer
 
provators
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
just
 
cash
 
based
 
ketamine
 
actually
 
both
 
it's
 
gonna
 
be
 
provato
 
and
 
also
 
the
 
iv
 
obviously
 
ketamine
 
the
 
cash
 
pay
 
and
 
as
 
well
 
if
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
pay
 
cash
 
for
 
obviously
 
for
 
the
 
provato
 
that's
 
an
 
option
 
but
 
iv
 
ketamine
 
then
 
also
 
I'm
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
offering
 
TMS
 
I'm
 
actually
 
waiting
 
for
 
the
 
gentleman
 
to
 
give
 
me
 
a
 
call
 
back
 
for
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
the
 
chair
 
and
 
everything
 
else
 
like
 
that
 
so
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
meeting
 
with
 
him
 
after
 
you
 
as
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
fact
 
so
 
okay
 
it's
 
the
 
first
 
time
 
that
 
you're
 
hopping
 
one
 
with
 
a
 
marketing
 
partner
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
what's
 
the
 
what's
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
you
 
generate
 
patients
 
right
 
now
 
for
 
your
 
clinic
 
is
 
there
 
a
 
specific
 
method
 
that
 
you
 
use
 
or
 
something
 
or
 
well
 
right
 
now
 
we
 
are
 
on
 
to
 
three
 
different
 
platforms
 
psychology
 
today
 
headway
 
and
 
alma
 
that
 
pretty
 
much
 
do
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
we
 
So
 
that's
 
where
 
we
 
get
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
our
 
marketing
 
from.
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
it
 
is
 
word
 
of
 
mouth
 
because
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of,
 
you
 
know,
 
in
 
contact
 
with
 
therapists,
 
different
 
psychiatrists,
 
and
 
then
 
also
 
to
 
social
 
media.
 
You
 
know,
 
we
 
have
 
both
 
Facebook
 
and
 
also
 
Instagram.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
cool.
 
So
 
how
 
many,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
idea?
 
What's
 
the,
 
like,
 
how
 
do
 
I
 
say
 
this
 
word?
 
How
 
do
 
you
 
split,
 
like,
 
what's
 
the
 
percentage
 
from
 
each
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
channels?
 
 
@3:24
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Like
 
from
 
word
 
of
 
mouth,
 
social
 
media,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
idea?
 
Like
 
roughly,
 
you
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
give
 
me.
 
Roughly.
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
our
 
patients
 
have
 
come
 
from
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
therapists
 
that
 
we
 
collaborate
 
with.
 
just
 
refer
 
patients
 
over.
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
out
 
of
 
100%,
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
at
 
least
 
half,
 
at
 
least
 
50%
 
is
 
coming
 
from
 
like
 
our
 
therapist.
 
And
 
then
 
definitely
 
word
 
of
 
mouth
 
because
 
she
 
has
 
always
 
been
 
in
 
psychiatry.
 
My
 
brother
 
happens
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
psychiatrist,
 
you
 
know,
 
so
 
it
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
works
 
out.
 
happen
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
psych
 
NP.
 
And
 
then
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
the
 
platforms,
 
it
 
just,
 
it
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
comes
 
up
 
from
 
one
 
there
 
as
 
well,
 
because
 
especially
 
when
 
people
 
know
 
they
 
need
 
to.
 
We
 
through
 
the
 
insurance
 
and
 
pay
 
for
 
it,
 
and
 
they
 
see
 
we
 
accept
 
insurances.
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
private
 
practices
 
don't
 
accept
 
insurance,
 
but
 
we
 
happen
 
to.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
different
 
billers
 
that
 
we
 
do
 
outside
 
of
 
Headway
 
and
 
Alma
 
that
 
do
 
credentialing
 
for
 
us
 
for
 
other
 
insurances
 
that
 
kind
 
of
 
help
 
us
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@4:15
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
cool.
 
So
 
how
 
many
 
patients
 
do
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
currently?
 
How
 
many
 
patients
 
have
 
you
 
seen
 
a
 
month
 
or
 
a
 
day
 
or
 
a
 
week?
 
 
@4:23
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
We
 
have
 
over
 
400
 
patients
 
in
 
the
 
practice
 
total,
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
non-ketamine
 
patients.
 
These
 
are
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
medical,
 
med
 
management.
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
because
 
we
 
both
 
don't
 
put
 
them
 
maybe
 
full-time
 
hours
 
a
 
week.
 
We
 
both
 
maybe
 
put
 
them
 
maybe
 
15,
 
20
 
hours
 
a
 
week
 
a
 
piece.
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
on
 
a
 
weekly
 
basis,
 
I
 
would
 
see
 
maybe,
 
maybe
 
40
 
patients.

Oh,
 
that's

@4:47

Belinda
 
Narine
 
That's
 
very
 
good.
 
 
@4:48

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Cool.
 
So
 
that's
 
a
 
nice
 
amount
 
of
 
patients.
 
Where
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to,
 
where
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
scale
 
it
 
to?
 
How
 
many
 
patients
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
have
 
like
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
90
 
days?
 
Like,
 
is
 
there
 
a
 
specific
 
goal
 
in
 
mind?
 
 
@5:01
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Well,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
I
 
find
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
little
 
challenging
 
only
 
because
 
with
 
ketamine,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
my
 
private
 
practice
 
patients,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
would
 
love
 
to
 
offer
 
them
 
ketamine,
 
but
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
them
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
because,
 
A,
 
whether
 
no
 
matter
 
how
 
much
 
I
 
explain
 
to
 
them,
 
they
 
may
 
be
 
scared
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
Also,
 
the
 
distance
 
is
 
also
 
has
 
been
 
an
 
issue
 
with
 
some
 
patients
 
in
 
mind
 
as
 
well,
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
their
 
back
 
and
 
forth
 
and
 
knowing
 
that
 
they
 
can't
 
drive
 
on
 
the
 
way
 
back
 
home.
 
And
 
then
 
also
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
my
 
patients,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
are
 
currently
 
doing
 
okay
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
on
 
oral
 
antidepressants.
 
have
 
maybe
 
about
 
10
 
that
 
are
 
willing
 
to
 
do
 
ketamine,
 
and
 
I've
 
had
 
a
 
couple
 
that
 
have
 
already
 
initiated
 
ketamine,
 
but
 
that
 
was
 
only
 
dispervato.
 
haven't
 
had
 
any
 
IV
 
ketamine
 
yet.

And
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
preference
 
towards
 
ketamine
 
or
 
spravato?
 
Do
 
you
 
mind
 
which
 
one
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
push
 
towards?
 
Because
 
technically,
 
IV
 
ketamine,
 
from
 
what
 
I've
 
noticed,
 
is
 
just
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
spravato,
 
but
 
spravato
 
has
 
way
 
more,
 
like,
 
credibility
 
to
 
it
 
because
 
it's,
 
you
 
know.
 
It
 
has
 
the
 
FDA
 
approval,
 
Johnson,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
asking,
 
is
 
there
 
a
 
specific
 
one
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
push
 
or
 
it
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
to
 
you?
 
 
@6:11
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
I
 
guess
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
specific
 
one
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
bioavailability
 
versus
 
IV
 
versus
 
intranasal
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
huge
 
difference.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it's
 
a
 
big
 
difference.
 
mean,
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
100%
 
being
 
bioavailability
 
for
 
the
 
IV
 
versus
 
87%
 
with
 
the
 
intranasal.
 
But
 
more
 
people
 
are
 
more
 
inclined
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
insurance,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean,
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
get
 
the
 
ketamine.
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
I
 
would
 
love
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
IV
 
ketamine
 
because
 
I
 
could
 
do
 
both
 
and
 
obviously
 
it's
 
cash
 
pay,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean,
 
that's
 
great,
 
you
 
know,
 
versus
 
the
 
Spravato.
 
So
 
I
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
push
 
the
 
IV,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
anything,
 
more
 
than
 
anything
 
else
 
because
 
the
 
Spravato
 
patients
 
or
 
anyone
 
that's
 
going
 
through
 
insurance,
 
think
 
it's
 
a
 
lot
 
easier
 
given
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
more
 
people
 
who
 
are
 
more
 
inclined
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
coverage
 
itself.
 
 
@6:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
right.
 
So
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
question
 
of
 
patients.
 
So
 
let's.
 
When
 
we
 
start
 
working
 
together,
 
everything's
 
perfect.
 
How
 
many
 
Spravato
 
patients
 
do
 
you
 
ideally
 
and
 
realistically
 
expect
 
to
 
see
 
within
 
90
 
days?
 
Like,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
goal
 
in
 
mind
 
or
 
something
 
that
 
you
 
strive
 
towards.
 
 
@7:14
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
My
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
definitely
 
have
 
at
 
least,
 
in
 
90
 
days,
 
at
 
least
 
15
 
chairs
 
kind
 
of
 
going.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
So
 
I
 
would,
 
would
 
say
 
15
 
patients
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis,
 
obviously,
 
and
 
tailored,
 
you
 
know,
 
and,
 
um,
 
well,
 
not,
 
not
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis,
 
but,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
good.
 
Depending
 
on
 
the
 
capacity
 
of
 
my
 
space,
 
because
 
I
 
could
 
only
 
hold
 
about
 
maybe
 
six
 
chairs
 
right
 
now,
 
you
 
know,
 
where
 
I
 
am.
 
And
 
then
 
obviously
 
as
 
I
 
grow,
 
I
 
can
 
always
 
get
 
more
 
space.
 
So
 
realistically,
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
really
 
have
 
a
 
nice,
 
good,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
12,
 
at
 
least
 
12
 
chairs,
 
you
 
know,
 
rotating
 
throughout
 
the
 
day.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
So
 
with
 
Spravato,
 
obviously
 
it's
 
a
 
two
 
hour
 
stretch
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
and
 
out.
 
And
 
then
 
obviously
 
with
 
the
 
IV
 
ketamine,
 
they
 
could
 
be
 
there
 
anyway
 
for
 
four
 
to
 
six
 
hours.
 
So
 
if
 
we're
 
looking
 
at
 
maybe
 
say
 
anywhere
 
from
 
eight
 
to
 
10
 
patients
 
a
 
day,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
I
 
mean?
 
Um,
 
on
 
a
 
three
 
day,
 
say
 
a
 
four
 
day
 
week,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
I
 
mean?
 
Uh,
 
think
 
that.
 
They
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
come
 
two
 
times
 
a
 
week
 
for
 
the
 
Sprobato,
 
and
 
then
 
as
 
needed
 
with
 
the
 
IV
 
ketamine,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
looking
 
at
 
maybe,
 
hopefully,
 
to
 
have
 
visits-wise,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
at
 
least
 
30
 
patients,
 
40
 
patients.

Okay.
 
And
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
fill
 
the
 
practice
 
to
 
be
 
full,
 
or
 
is
 
there
 
another
 
reason
 
as
 
to
 
why
 
you
 
want,
 
like,
 
this
 
amount
 
of
 
patients
 
specifically?
 
 
@8:26
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
I'm
 
just
 
giving
 
you
 
a
 
number.
 
 
@8:27

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
never
 
had
 
to
 
have
 
to
 
break
 
it
 
down.
 
 
@8:28
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
As
 
much
 
as
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
on
 
board,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
That's
 
a
 
goal.
 
I
 
mean,
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
me
 
having
 
to
 
get
 
additional
 
help
 
to
 
help
 
manage,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
intensive
 
care
 
unit
 
registered
 
nurses
 
that
 
can
 
help
 
me
 
manage,
 
and
 
the
 
key
 
is
 
I
 
just
 
really
 
would
 
love
 
to
 
just
 
focus
 
on
 
dysketamine
 
and
 
let
 
that
 
be
 
my
 
niche,
 
that
 
be
 
my
 
goal,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
can
 
come
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
hospital
 
setting,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
into
 
the
 
hospital
 
setting
 
and
 
do
 
a
 
night
 
shift
 
anymore.
 
 
@8:49

Oriel

I
 
can
 
just
 
focus
 
on
 
dysketamine.
 
Okay,
 
sounds
 
good.
 
Okay,
 
so,
 
let's
 
see
 
if
 
there's
 
specific,
 
there
 
were
 
specific
 
questions
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
ask
 
you.
 
So,
 
okay,
 
I
 
noticed
 
that
 
we
 
really
 
truly
 
do
 
not
 
work
 
with
 
everyone
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
very
 
pushing,
 
okay,
 
we
 
are
 
pushing
 
our
 
clients
 
a
 
lot
 
to
 
do
 
specific
 
work
 
that
 
other
 
clinics
 
or
 
clinic
 
owners
 
sometimes
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
do.
 
For
 
example,
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
things
 
is
 
filming
 
videos,
 
okay?
 
We
 
send
 
you
 
video
 
scripts,
 
you
 
film
 
the
 
videos,
 
we
 
edit
 
them.
 
Do
 
you
 
see,
 
because
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
you're
 
a
 
bit
 
full
 
right
 
now,
 
you
 
said
 
that
 
you
 
work
 
late
 
last
 
night.
 
Do
 
you
 
think
 
you
 
would
 
have
 
the
 
capacity
 
and
 
ability
 
to
 
film
 
videos
 
as
 
we
 
tell
 
you?
 
 
@9:36
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Oh,
 
yeah.
 
 
@9:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
yeah,
 
for
 
sure.
 
 
@9:38
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Yeah,
 
for
 
sure?
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
 
@9:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Another
 
thing
 
is
 
testimonials,
 
okay?
 
You
 
have
 
10
 
patients
 
you
 
said
 
right
 
now
 
on
 
IV
 
ketamine.
 
These
 
people
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
results,
 
okay?
 
They're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
results
 
100%,
 
it
 
works.
 
How
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
problem
 
would
 
it
 
be
 
to
 
you
 
to,
 
once
 
every
 
two
 
to
 
four
 
weeks,
 
have
 
a
 
mini
 
shooting
 
day
 
in
 
your
 
office?
 
Just,
 
.
 
your
 
phone,
 
prop
 
it
 
up,
 
and
 
have
 
a
 
testimonial
 
with
 
them.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
framework
 
that
 
we
 
give
 
you,
 
okay,
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
ask
 
them
 
specific
 
questions.
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
also
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
a
 
client
 
of
 
mine
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
how
 
it
 
works.
 
So
 
would
 
that
 
be
 
a
 
problem
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
propose
 
that
 
to
 
your
 
clients
 
because
 
we
 
do
 
create
 
ads
 
based
 
on
 
these
 
stories?
 
 
@10:17
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
No,
 
I
 
would
 
definitely
 
know
 
who
 
I
 
could
 
and
 
who
 
I
 
could
 
not
 
because
 
I
 
have,
 
for
 
example,
 
I
 
have
 
one
 
young
 
lady
 
who
 
is
 
from
 
Croatia.
 
She
 
does
 
not,
 
my
 
parents,
 
she's
 
just
 
like
 
a
 
taboo
 
of
 
having
 
any
 
kind
 
of
 
mental
 
illness.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
million
 
ladies
 
from
 
Nigeria
 
that,
 
oh,
 
absolutely
 
not.
 
So
 
I
 
know
 
certain
 
people
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
I
 
would
 
not
 
ask,
 
but
 
there's
 
some
 
people
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
more
 
inclined
 
to
 
go
 
ahead
 
and
 
wouldn't
 
mind
 
doing
 
a
 
testimonial.
 
 
@10:39

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
not
 
a
 
Awesome,
 
awesome.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
now,
 
let's
 
dive
 
a
 
bit
 
deeper
 
into
 
technical
 
numbers,
 
okay?
 
Because
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
understand,
 
because
 
you
 
haven't
 
done
 
marketing
 
before,
 
I
 
could
 
propose
 
a
 
price,
 
say
 
what
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
invest.
 
It
 
could
 
sound
 
like
 
it's
 
a
 
lot
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
understand
 
the
 
numbers
 
in
 
the
 
back
 
end.
 
So,
 
I
 
want
 
to...
 
So
 
you,
 
how
 
much
 
do
 
you
 
get,
 
let's
 
say
 
there's
 
a
 
Spravato
 
patient
 
that
 
signs
 
in
 
insurance,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
for
 
a
 
full
 
treatment,
 
before
 
the
 
maintenance,
 
how
 
much
 
is
 
each
 
client
 
worth
 
to
 
you
 
in
 
profit?
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
after
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
insurance
 
cut
 
off
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
how
 
much
 
profit
 
is
 
left
 
in
 
your
 
pocket
 
for
 
one
 
Spravato
 
client?
 
 
@11:23
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Once
 
Spravato
 
client
 
per
 
session,
 
because
 
they
 
come
 
in
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
so
 
if
 
they
 
come
 
once,
 
if
 
they
 
come
 
every
 
day,
 
two
 
days
 
a
 
week,
 
every
 
session
 
would
 
be
 
after
 
the
 
insurance
 
and
 
everything
 
else,
 
the
 
calculation
 
came
 
out
 
to
 
be
 
about
 
410.
 
 
@11:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
410,
 
so
 
that's
 
what
 
you
 
get
 
in
 
your
 
pocket?
 
 
@11:43
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
In
 
your
 
pocket,
 
that's
 
after
 
they
 
take
 
out
 
everything.
 
 
@11:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Okay,
 
and
 
do
 
you
 
see,
 
and
 
do
 
people,
 
when
 
they
 
start,
 
do
 
they
 
put
 
that
 
twice
 
a
 
week?
 
Like,
 
do
 
they
 
put
 
the
 
work
 
income
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
or
 
are
 
there
 
people
 
that
 
come
 
once
 
a
 
week,
 
or
 
just
 
like…
 
Right,
 
that's
 
the
 
next
 
thing,
 
exactly,
 
because
 
some
 
people…
 
 
@12:00
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
I'm
 
not
 
as
 
compliant.
 
So
 
I've
 
had
 
a
 
few
 
people
 
that'll
 
come
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
supposedly
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
four
 
weeks,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
have
 
some
 
people
 
that
 
come
 
once
 
a
 
week,
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
next
 
week
 
they
 
don't
 
come.
 
So
 
it
 
really
 
just
 
depends.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
basing
 
it
 
on,
 
like,
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
one
 
person
 
that
 
comes
 
that
 
day,
 
how
 
much
 
I
 
would
 
get
 
for
 
that
 
session,
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
calculate
 
it
 
over
 
that.

Mm-hmm.
 
So
 
let's
 
take
 
a
 
situation
 
in
 
which
 
it's
 
not
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
also
 
way
 
less
 
than
 
that.
 
So
 
let's
 
say
 
once
 
a
 
week.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
once
 
a
 
week,
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
for
 
each
 
patient
 
that
 
you
 
generate,
 
you
 
generate
 
$1,600
 
a
 
month
 
approximately.
 
$16.40,
 
correct?

If
 
you
 
do
 
it
 
once
 
a
 
week.

Cool.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
if
 
we
 
say,
 
for
 
example,
 
let's
 
take,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
I
 
should
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
Google
 
Doc
 
here
 
and
 
do
 
a
 
little,
 
okay,
 
let's
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
Google
 
Doc,
 
see
 
how
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
this.

Let's
 
just
 
do
 
it
 
spontaneously,
 
because
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
the
 
numbers.
 
Just
 
a
 
second.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
we
 
get
 
five
 
new
 
patients
 
a
 
month,
 
okay,
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
see
 
that
 
is
 
possible,
 
five
 
new
 
patients
 
a
 
month,
 
that's
 
worth
 
approximately
 
1640
 
times
 
four
 
is
 
six,
 
let's
 
do
 
that
 
now,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
not
 
the
 
best
 
math
 
guy,
 
so.
 
Let's
 
do
 
this
 
real
 
quick,
 
times
 
four
 
is
 
6550,
 
okay,
 
6550,
 
so
 
typically
 
what
 
we
 
want
 
our
 
clients
 
to
 
spend,
 
okay,
 
that's
 
the
 
bare
 
minimum,
 
is
 
$30
 
a
 
day
 
on
 
ads,
 
$30
 
to
 
$40
 
a
 
day
 
on
 
ads,
 
which
 
is
 
usually
 
between
 
$900
 
to
 
$1,200
 
a
 
month,
 
okay,
 
that's
 
on
 
ads.
 
Now,
 
from
 
these
 
numbers,
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
get,
 
if.
 
We
 
get
 
five
 
patients
 
a
 
month,
 
which
 
is,
 
again,
 
an
 
estimate.
 
It
 
also
 
depends
 
a
 
lot
 
on
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
sales
 
abilities
 
and
 
whether
 
you
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
the
 
clients
 
in
 
the
 
clinic
 
itself.
 
That
 
means
 
that
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
patient
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
let's
 
put
 
that
 
in
 
the
 
low
 
end,
 
so
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$1,200
 
divided
 
by
 
five.
 
That
 
means
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
patient
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$240,
 
okay?
 
Now,
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
okay,
 
and
 
that's
 
a
 
simple
 
question,
 
is
 
whether
 
if
 
you
 
spend
 
$240
 
and
 
you
 
get
 
$640
 
back,
 
is
 
that
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
would
 
consider
 
as
 
profitable?
 
Obviously,
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
yes,
 
but
 
the
 
question
 
is,
 
how
 
much
 
would
 
it
 
be
 
profitable
 
to
 
you?
 
Do
 
you
 
think
 
that's
 
worth
 
it?
 
Because
 
you
 
obviously
 
get
 
your
 
money
 
back.
 
Right.
 
 
@14:42

Belinda
 
Narine
 
No,
 
that's
 
definitely
 
worth
 
it.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it
 
definitely
 
costs
 
to
 
market,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
So
 
these
 
numbers
 
are
 
not,
 
they're
 
not
 
abnormal.
 
I
 
mean,
 
not
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
how
 
the
 
marketing
 
game
 
goes,
 
but
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
have
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
to
 
spend
 
money,
 
you
 
have
 
to,
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
money
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
spend,
 
you
 
know.
 
feelsinct?
 
You
 
can't
 
just
 
not
 
spend
 
something,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean?

So
 
I
 
get
 
it.
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
glad
 
you
 
like
 
it.
 
So,
 
$240,
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
see.
 
Now,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
okay,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
situation
 
here.
 
Obviously,
 
it
 
could
 
not
 
be
 
five
 
patients,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
less,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
three,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
two.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
what's
 
the
 
minimum?
 
Like,
 
what's
 
the
 
maximum
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition?
 
So
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
that
 
we
 
proposed
 
here
 
was
 
$240.
 
 
@15:25
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
What's
 
the
 
maximum
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
that
 
you're
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
in
 
order
 
for
 
this
 
to
 
be
 
profitable
 
to
 
you?
 
Think
 
about
 
it
 
for
 
a
 
second.
 
I
 
guess
 
because
 
every
 
insurance
 
is
 
different,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean,
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
what
 
you
 
get,
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
the
 
rate
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
get
 
paid
 
back.
 
If
 
these
 
are
 
all
 
out-of-pocket
 
patients,
 
know,
 
then
 
I
 
could
 
say
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
set
 
number,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
price,
 
is
 
what
 
it
 
is.
 
So
 
it
 
just,
 
I
 
guess
 
it
 
kind
 
of
 
depends.
 
I
 
mean,
 
anywhere
 
between
 
a
 
patient,
 
I'm
 
saying
 
$240,
 
I'll
 
say
 
anywhere
 
between
 
$200
 
to
 
$240.
 
It
 
would
 
be
 
appropriate.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
guess
 
it
 
just
 
depends
 
on
 
which
 
insurance
 
it
 
is.
 
I
 
have,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
insurances
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
pay
 
nurse
 
practitioners
 
the
 
full
 
rate
 
versus
 
it
 
being
 
for
 
a
 
physician.
 
So
 
it
 
just
 
really
 
just
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
insurance
 
and
 
everything.
 
So
 
some
 
people
 
may
 
be,
 
you
 
know,
 
410
 
per
 
patient,
 
you
 
know,
 
per
 
session,
 
you
 
know,
 
versus
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
less.
 
 
@16:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It
 
could
 
be
 
350
 
depending
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
insurance.
 
Okay,
 
so,
 
so
 
what's
 
the
 
so
 
240
 
is
 
the
 
max
 
that
 
you're
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
that?
 
Or
 
is
 
it?
 
Do
 
you
 
see
 
like,
 
if,
 
for
 
example,
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
because
 
there's
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
there
 
is
 
obviously
 
our
 
marketing
 
costs.
 
So
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
understand
 
here,
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
max
 
amount
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
for
 
your
 
time
 
and
 
for
 
what
 
you
 
are
 
given,
 
because
 
you
 
are
 
giving
 
a
 
service
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
and
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
money
 
off
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
is
 
the
 
410
 
like
 
the,
 
the,
 
the
 
good
 
side?
 
of
 
the
 
money
 
that
 
you
 
get
 
paid?
 
Or
 
is
 
it
 
like,
 
on
 
average,
 
could
 
it
 
be
 
more
 
for
 
insurance?
 
Or
 
is
 
it
 
usually
 
less?
 
 
@16:57
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Because
 
that's
 
also,
 
um,
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
most
 
it
 
would
 
go
 
So
 
if
 
you're
 
doing
 
that
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
I
 
would
 
try
 
to
 
like
 
be
 
realistic
 
if
 
it's
 
the
 
low
 
end
 
versus
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
go
 
right
 
in
 
the
 
center.
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
just
 
say
 
$400
 
per
 
patient
 
because
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
anywhere
 
from
 
$350
 
to
 
$360
 
depending
 
on
 
which
 
insurance
 
is
 
versus
 
the
 
maximum
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
with
 
certain
 
insurances
 
is
 
like
 
$450
 
to
 
$460,
 
yeah.
 
 
@17:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Again,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
think?
 
Because
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
our
 
marketing
 
costs.
 
Our
 
cost
 
is
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
month,
 
we
 
don't
 
charge
 
a
 
retainer.
 
We
 
only
 
charge
 
a
 
setup
 
fee,
 
which
 
is
 
$897,
 
okay?
 
So
 
that's
 
just
 
create
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
the
 
foundations
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
But
 
after
 
that,
 
we
 
have
 
two
 
models.
 
One
 
is
 
the
 
flat
 
retainer
 
model,
 
which
 
is
 
$1,600
 
a
 
month.
 
And
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
is
 
a
 
lower
 
base,
 
a
 
lower
 
retainer
 
model,
 
but
 
we
 
get
 
paid
 
more
 
on
 
performance.
 
So
 
we
 
get
 
paid
 
$500,
 
the
 
base,
 
and
 
then
 
it's
 
$100
 
for
 
every
 
appointment.
 
And
 
if
 
the
 
appointment
 
doesn't
 
show
 
up,
 
we
 
cut
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
asking
 
you,
 
like,
 
at
 
what
 
point
 
would
 
this
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
be
 
like,
 
okay,
 
Oriel,
 
this
 
is
 
too
 
much
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
profitable
 
to
 
me.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
I'm
 
digging
 
deep
 
here
 
because
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
numbers
 
and
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
us
 
to
 
run
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
blind.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
transparent
 
here
 
with
 
you.
 
So
 
what's
 
the
 
max
 
that
 
you
 
think
 
that
 
you
 
could
 
do
 
in
 
that
 
sense?
 
Because
 
if
 
we
 
take,
 
for
 
example,
 
we
 
take
 
the
 
$1,200
 
and
 
we
 
combine
 
our
 
$1,500,
 
okay,
 
and
 
from
 
the
 
second
 
month,
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$2,700.
 
And
 
from
 
these
 
$2,700,
 
if
 
we
 
get
 
five
 
patients,
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
it's
 
about
 
520,
 
if
 
I'm
 
not
 
mistaken,
 
five,
 
let
 
me,
 
math
 
ain't
 
math
 
in
 
today.
 
So
 
it's
 
540.
 
I
 
was
 
close.
 
So
 
540.
 
So
 
my
 
question
 
is,
 
is
 
it
 
a
 
number
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
okay
 
with?
 
know,
 
considering
 
obviously
 
there
 
are
 
factors
 
that
 
we
 
cannot
 
control.
 
For
 
example,
 
people
 
could
 
be
 
coming
 
twice.
 
So
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
asking.
 
Where
 
does
 
the
 
line
 
draw?
 
Because
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
us
 
also
 
a
 
clear
 
understanding
 
for
 
going
 
ahead
 
because
 
we
 
know,
 
okay,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
want.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
maximum
 
that
 
we're
 
willing
 
to
 
pay.
 
And
 
everything
 
beyond
 
that
 
is
 
just
 
not
 
good.
 
So
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
asking.
 
 
@19:22
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
So
 
that
 
540
 
number
 
is
 
per
 
month?
 
 
@19:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
like
 
the
 
540
 
is
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition.
 
So
 
that's
 
how
 
much
 
it
 
costs
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
new
 
patient
 
in
 
chair
 
to
 
start
 
treatment.
 
 
@19:36
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
Gotcha.
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
okay,
 
I
 
see
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
So
 
if
 
it's
 
540,
 
well,
 
that's
 
a
 
lot.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
Technically,
 
if
 
I'm
 
only
 
getting,
 
well,
 
no,
 
that's
 
540
 
per
 
patient
 
per
 
chair
 
per
 
month
 
or
 
per
 
visit.
 
 
@19:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
Wait,
 
can
 
you
 
repeat
 
the
 
question?
 
 
@19:57
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Per
 
patient
 
per
 
visit
 
per
 
 
@20:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
the
 
540?
 
Yeah.
 
Oh,
 
no,
 
no.
 
That's
 
for
 
a
 
new
 
patient.
 
So
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
540.
 
So
 
you
 
get
 
the,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
know
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
confusing
 
in
 
the
 
start,
 
but
 
it's
 
hard,
 
I
 
know,
 
but
 
it's
 
really
 
worth
 
to
 
listen
 
to
 
it.
 
Because
 
if
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
of
 
a
 
new
 
patient,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
CPA
 
is
 
540.
 
In
 
the
 
end,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
how
 
much
 
is
 
the
 
client
 
worth
 
in
 
general.
 
So
 
the
 
1640
 
is
 
just
 
for
 
one
 
month,
 
but
 
if
 
they
 
continue
 
to
 
come
 
week
 
after
 
week
 
for
 
two
 
months,
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
their
 
value
 
is
 
not
 
1640
 
anymore.
 
It's
 
double
 
that.
 
 
@20:35

Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
 
@20:36

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it's
 
540
 
to
 
acquire
 
the
 
patient.
 
And
 
then
 
everything
 
after
 
that
 
is
 
basically
 
the
 
profit
 
is
 
all
 
yours
 
because
 
the
 
client
 
keeps
 
on
 
coming.
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
marketing
 
to
 
keep
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
maintaining
 
this
 
client.
 
 
@20:48

Belinda
 
Narine
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
Gotcha.
 
 
@20:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Gotcha.
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
what,
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
asking.
 
So
 
if
 
that
 
number
 
is
 
good,
 
is
 
that
 
number
 
good?
 
Is
 
it
 
not
 
good?
 
Like,
 
because
 
you
 
know,
 
that's,
 
that's,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@20:58
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
I
 
don't,
 
I'm
 
like,
 
that's,
 
I'm
 
like,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
make
 
You're
 
saying
 
I'm
 
actually
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
deficit.
 
So
 
I
 
didn't
 
understand.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
no,
 
no,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
So
 
if
 
that
 
is
 
a
 
price
 
per
 
patient
 
per
 
acquisition,
 
you're
 
saying
 
either
 
then,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
So
 
then
 
540
 
would
 
be
 
appropriate,
 
given,
 
hopefully,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
I
 
mean,
 
they
 
do
 
the
 
whole
 
duration
 
of
 
the
 
treatment.
 
Because
 
if
 
that's
 
the
 
case,
 
if
 
they're
 
coming
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
for,
 
you
 
know,
 
four
 
weeks,
 
and
 
then
 
once
 
a
 
week,
 
you
 
know,
 
they're
 
at
 
the
 
key
 
is
 
to
 
then
 
have
 
them
 
come
 
twice
 
a
 
week
 
for
 
at
 
least
 
six
 
weeks,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
But
 
I'm
 
not
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
people
 
in
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
challenge.
 
So
 
even
 
if
 
it's
 
just
 
twice
 
a
 
week
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
four
 
weeks
 
with
 
the
 
540
 
per
 
patient
 
per
 
acquisition,
 
that
 
actually
 
is
 
that
 
that's
 
fair.
 
 
@21:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
great.
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
understand.
 
Because
 
there
 
are
 
people
 
that
 
come
 
to
 
us,
 
and
 
they
 
have,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
different
 
model,
 
or
 
something's
 
just
 
not
 
working
 
there.
 
Like,
 
I'm
 
not
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
that.
 
So
 
it's
 
important
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
transparent.
 
So
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
end
 
the
 
month.
 
And
 
because
 
there
 
are
 
people,
 
for
 
example,
 
colleagues
 
of
 
mine
 
that
 
don't
 
do
 
that,
 
don't
 
do
 
that
 
transparency,
 
because
 
they
 
say,
 
Oh,
 
it's
 
too
 
complicated
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
the
 
client
 
on
 
the
 
end.
 
But
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
they
 
generate
 
five
 
to
 
10
 
patients
 
to
 
people,
 
and
 
the
 
clients
 
are
 
complaining
 
because
 
they
 
don't
 
understand
 
the
 
numbers
 
in
 
the
 
back
 
end.
 
So
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
this
 
mess
 
here
 
to
 
understand
 
that
 
it's
 
worth
 
it
 
to
 
you.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
that
 
is
 
basically
 
it.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
what
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
obviously
 
get
 
the
 
cost
 
requisite
 
to
 
be
 
lower
 
and
 
lower
 
and
 
lower,
 
but
 
that
 
is
 
also
 
dependent
 
on
 
all
 
of
 
us.
 
You
 
know,
 
creating
 
new
 
ads,
 
getting
 
new
 
testimonials,
 
getting
 
the
 
sales
 
process
 
refined
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
help
 
us
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
get
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
to
 
be
 
lowered
 
and
 
the
 
patient's
 
value
 
to
 
be
 
higher.
 
Now,
 
another
 
question
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
understand
 
just
 
so
 
we
 
have,
 
and
 
that's
 
probably,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
that
 
metric,
 
is
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
what's
 
your
 
average
 
lifetime
 
value?
 
Like,
 
so
 
as
 
a
 
provato
 
patient
 
signs
 
up
 
for
 
a
 
treatment,
 
how
 
much
 
are
 
they
 
worth
 
in
 
general?
 
Like,
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
average
 
is?
 
Do
 
they
 
usually
 
are
 
worth
 
$4,000,
 
$5,000?
 
Our
 
people
 
usually
 
come
 
in
 
just
 
for
 
one
 
month
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
stop.
 
So
 
their
 
value
 
is
 
$1,600.
 
So,
 
like,
 
what's
 
the,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
idea
 
what
 
this
 
number
 
is?
 
 
@23:05
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
I
 
don't,
 
because
 
I
 
haven't
 
had
 
someone
 
that
 
actually
 
went
 
exactly
 
with
 
the
 
program
 
as
 
indicated,
 
because
 
some
 
people
 
get
 
symptom
 
relief
 
so
 
quickly,
 
so
 
they
 
may
 
not
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
whole
 
entire
 
process.
 
So,
 
say,
 
for
 
example,
 
dispervado,
 
I've
 
had
 
patients
 
that
 
did
 
the
 
four
 
weeks,
 
and
 
then
 
they're
 
supposed
 
to
 
come
 
at
 
least
 
another
 
two
 
more
 
weeks,
 
and
 
then
 
once
 
a
 
week,
 
you
 
know,
 
until,
 
you
 
know,
 
they
 
really
 
kind
 
of
 
get
 
through
 
that
 
remission
 
phase.
 
And
 
some
 
people
 
just
 
feel
 
great
 
after
 
the
 
first,
 
like,
 
four
 
weeks,
 
and
 
they
 
don't
 
come
 
back,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
come
 
back
 
again,
 
and
 
there's
 
a
 
big
 
gap
 
and
 
what
 
have
 
you.
 
But
 
I
 
try
 
my
 
best
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
have
 
them
 
be
 
consistent
 
for
 
a
 
good,
 
you
 
know,
 
three
 
to
 
four-month
 
stretch,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
can
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
sporadically
 
come
 
here
 
and
 
thereafter.
 
But
 
I
 
haven't
 
had
 
no
 
one
 
that's
 
done
 
the
 
actual
 
program
 
the
 
way
 
I
 
implemented
 
it,
 
because
 
they
 
just
 
feel
 
better,
 
you
 
know,
 
sooner
 
than
 
later.
 
 
@23:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
if
 
we
 
take
 
a
 
rough
 
estimate,
 
what
 
would
 
you
 
say,
 
you
 
know,
 
from
 
your
 
field,
 
like,
 
from
 
feeling
 
like,
 
let's
 
do
 
quick
 
math
 
here.
 
So,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
So
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
worst
 
case
 
scenario
 
here,
 
because
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
love
 
to
 
optimize
 
towards,
 
because
 
we
 
can
 
take
 
the
 
best
 
case
 
scenario,
 
oh,
 
everybody's
 
coming
 
for
 
two
 
times
 
a
 
week,
 
six
 
weeks,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
maintenance
 
session
 
for
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
their
 
lives.
 
And
 
then
 
they're
 
worth,
 
you
 
know,
 
tens
 
of
 
thousands
 
of
 
dollars.
 
But
 
obviously,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
reality.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you,
 
where
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
the
 
range
 
lying
 
there?
 
Like
 
what's
 
the,
 
where
 
is
 
it
 
lying,
 
the
 
value?
 
 
@24:30
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
So
 
if
 
we
 
see
 
the
 
value,
 
if
 
they
 
at
 
least
 
did
 
a
 
month,
 
let's
 
say
 
if
 
they
 
just
 
did
 
at
 
least
 
a
 
month.
 
So
 
say,
 
for
 
example,
 
we
 
lowball
 
it
 
to
 
350
 
per
 
session
 
per
 
patient.
 
So
 
if
 
they
 
come
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
350
 
and
 
350,
 
that's
 
700,
 
and
 
seven
 
times
 
four
 
is
 
what,
 
28.
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
if
 
they
 
came
 
consistently
 
on
 
a
 
lowball
 
and
 
insurance
 
company,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
at
 
least
 
say
 
3000.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
It
 
would
 
be
 
for
 
a
 
patient
 
consistent
 
for
 
a
 
month.
 
And
 
if
 
they
 
did
 
that.
 
Right.
 
At
 
least
 
three
 
times
 
back
 
to
 
back.
 
you
 
have,
 
you
 
know,
 
it'd
 
be
 
three
 
times
 
three,
 
9,000
 
if
 
they
 
did
 
it.
 
What
 
I
 
really
 
would
 
like
 
people
 
to
 
come
 
twice
 
a
 
week,
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
a
 
good
 
90
 
days.
 
know,
 
have
 
more
 
than
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
but
 
they,
 
not
 
90
 
days,
 
but
 
you
 
mean
 
three
 
months.
 
So
 
if
 
they
 
did
 
that
 
consistently,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
like
 
$9,000
 
for
 
the
 
most
 
part,
 
you
 
know,
 
in
 
a
 
three
 
month
 
stretch
 
if
 
they
 
did
 
it
 
the
 
way
 
they
 
were
 
supposed
 
to.
 
And
 
that's
 
low
 
balling
 
the
 
insurance
 
company.
 
 
@25:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
ideal
 
lifetime
 
value
 
is
 
$9,000.
 
Average
 
lifetime
 
value
 
that
 
we
 
expect
 
is
 
$3,000.
 
Okay,
 
great.
 
Now
 
from
 
this
 
number,
 
okay,
 
from
 
$3,000.
 
 
@25:45

Belinda

Now
 
let's
 
go
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
CPA.
 
 
@25:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What's
 
the
 
maximum
 
amount,
 
knowing
 
that
 
our
 
average
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
3000.
 
What's
 
the
 
maximum
 
amount
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
per
 
patient
 
acquisition?
 
Like
 
where,
 
where's
 
the
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
you're
 
saying,
 
okay,
 
oil
 
too
 
much.
 
to
 
So
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
things
 
here.
 
 
@26:04
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
optimize,
 
so
 
I'm
 
not
 
understanding
 
the
 
question,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
optimize.
 
 
@26:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
let's
 
say,
 
what's
 
the
 
maximum
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
that
 
we're
 
willing
 
to
 
pay,
 
knowing
 
that
 
our
 
average
 
lifetime
 
value
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
$3,000?
 
 
@26:15
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
That's
 
on
 
the
 
low
 
end.
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
on
 
the
 
low
 
end,
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
for,
 
that's
 
for
 
a
 
month.
 
 
@26:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
for
 
a
 
month.
 
 
@26:23
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Okay,
 
yeah.
 
So,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
thought
 
that
 
was
 
the
 
540
 
would
 
be
 
appropriate.
 
 
@26:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
no,
 
yeah.
 
So
 
what's
 
the
 
maximum
 
amount,
 
like,
 
beyond
 
that?
 
Is
 
540
 
the
 
most
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
pay?
 
Like,
 
if
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$800,
 
is
 
that
 
above
 
your
 
KPI,
 
above
 
what
 
you
 
feel
 
like
 
you
 
can
 
deal
 
with,
 
or
 
you
 
think
 
that
 
it's
 
profitable
 
to
 
you?
 
Is
 
it
 
$1,000?
 
Like,
 
what's
 
the
 
worst
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
that
 
we're
 
willing
 
to
 
endure
 
after
 
we
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
point,
 
like,
 
okay,
 
this
 
is
 
too
 
much,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
here.
 
So,
 
like,
 
what's
 
the
 
worst?
 
 
@26:56
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
definitely,
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what.
 
I'm
 
getting
 
out
 
of
 
it.
 
You
 
know,
 
I
 
would
 
definitely
 
try
 
to
 
keep
 
it,
 
you
 
know,
 
realistic.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
pay
 
so
 
much
 
and
 
then
 
get
 
zero
 
out
 
of
 
it.
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
definitely
 
say
 
anywhere
 
from
 
540
 
to,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
540
 
to
 
600,
 
you
 
know,
 
for
 
acquisition,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
And
 
then
 
depending
 
on
 
how
 
well
 
it
 
happens
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
optimize
 
it
 
from
 
there.
 
But
 
unless
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
see,
 
you
 
know,
 
how
 
I'm
 
making
 
out
 
versus
 
how
 
much
 
I'm
 
getting
 
from
 
the
 
output
 
of
 
it,
 
then
 
I
 
can
 
say
 
maybe
 
it
 
can
 
go
 
higher
 
than
 
that.
 
But
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
the
 
max,
 
depending
 
on
 
what
 
I'm
 
getting
 
on
 
the
 
lifetime
 
of
 
the
 
patient,
 
nothing
 
is
 
guaranteed
 
but
 
death
 
and
 
taxes,
 
right?

So
 
I
 
would
 
say,
 
you
 
know,
 
for
 
the
 
most,
 
I
 
would
 
maybe
 
go
 
in
 
the
 
beginning
 
for
 
650,
 
you
 
know,
 
depending.
 
 
@27:37
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Yeah.
 
 
@27:38
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
Yeah.
 
Okay.
 
Sounds
 
good.
 
So
 
max
 
CPA
 
for
 
us
 
is
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
strive
 
towards
 
650.
 
Anything
 
beyond
 
that,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
into
 
the
 
funnel,
 
optimize,
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
there.
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
So
 
that
 
was
 
our
 
math
 
class
 
for
 
today.
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
just
 
go
 
over
 
this
 
with
 
you
 
and
 
just
 
lay
 
out
 
the
 
numbers.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
basically
 
it.
 
So
 
As
 
I've
 
told
 
you
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
month
 
for
 
investing
 
in
 
ads,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
between
 
$900
 
to
 
$1,200.
 
That's
 
a
 
bare
 
minimum.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
film
 
the
 
ads.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
patients
 
that
 
are
 
already
 
ready
 
to
 
get
 
testimonials,
 
we
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
framework
 
to
 
film
 
out
 
these
 
testimonials
 
because
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
ads
 
from
 
them.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
always,
 
like
 
at
 
least
 
once
 
a
 
month,
 
have
 
new
 
ads
 
because
 
you're
 
in
 
a
 
local
 
area
 
and
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
leverage
 
story-based
 
ads
 
because
 
these
 
work
 
the
 
best.
 
So
 
there
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
always
 
war
 
going
 
there.
 
Another
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
know
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
help
 
you.
 
Wait.
 
So
 
before
 
that,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
care
 
coordinator
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
call
 
the
 
leads
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
time?
 
 
@28:41
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Like,
 
how
 
does
 
it
 
work?
 
As
 
far
 
as
 
what
 
we
 
don't
 
do
 
call,
 
leads
 
at
 
all.
 
 
@28:45
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
We
 
don't.
 
No,
 
no,
 
no,
 
no,
 
no,
 
no,
 
call.
 
No,
 
not
 
calling
 
the
 
leads.
 
Like
 
when
 
leads
 
come
 
in,
 
who
 
calls
 
them
 
to
 
like
 
do
 
that
 
care
 
coordination
 
before
 
they
 
come
 
to
 
the
 
clinic?
 
 
@28:53
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Oh,
 
we
 
have
 
our
 
virtual
 
assistant
 
or
 
myself,
 
either
 
or,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
mean?
 
 
@28:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Depends.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
do
 
and.
 
So
 
in
 
this
 
area
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
voice
 
AI
 
agent,
 
which
 
basically
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
care
 
coordinator
 
that
 
calls
 
leads
 
within
 
five
 
minutes,
 
gets
 
them
 
to
 
book.
 
That
 
increases
 
bookings
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
increases
 
show
 
up
 
rates
 
because
 
it
 
optimizes
 
towards
 
booking
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
closest
 
time
 
possible.
 
So
 
that's
 
another
 
thing
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
test
 
phase
 
for
 
that.
 
So
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
60
 
days,
 
you
 
get
 
that
 
completely
 
for
 
free.
 
After
 
that,
 
it's
 
$1,000
 
a
 
month
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
want
 
to
 
keep
 
it.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
know
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@29:27
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Okay.
 
 
@29:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
basically,
 
the
 
budget
 
to
 
start
 
with
 
is
 
$900,
 
$1,200.
 
For
 
the
 
first
 
month,
 
you
 
pay
 
us
 
only
 
for
 
the
 
setup
 
fee,
 
which
 
is
 
$897.
 
And
 
after
 
that,
 
you
 
can
 
choose
 
between
 
the
 
$1,500
 
retainer
 
or
 
the
 
lowered
 
base
 
and
 
the
 
optimized.
 
 
@29:47
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
optimize
 
based
 
on
 
performance.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense
 
to
 
you?
 
that
 
cool?
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
definitely
 
makes
 
sense.
 
It's
 
just
 
something,
 
yeah,
 
definitely.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
unrealistic.
 
It's
 
just
 
that
 
I
 
guess
 
we
 
After
 
the
 
phone
 
call,
 
kind
 
of
 
go
 
through
 
everything,
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
thinking,
 
just
 
kind
 
of,
 
you
 
know,
 
make
 
a
 
clear
 
cut
 
decision,
 
but
 
it
 
definitely
 
is,
 
it
 
does
 
make
 
sense.
 
does
 
sound
 
fair.
 
mean,
 
definitely
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
ads,
 
being,
 
participating
 
in
 
videos
 
and
 
things
 
like
 
that,
 
so
 
it's
 
just
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
time
 
consuming,
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
problem
 
doing
 
that
 
because
 
it's
 
for
 
my
 
business.
 
I'm
 
not
 
doing
 
it
 
for
 
someone
 
else's
 
business,
 
so
 
have
 
no
 
problem
 
doing
 
that.
 
And
 
the
 
structure
 
of
 
it,
 
of
 
how
 
we
 
have
 
like
 
certain
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
say,
 
certain
 
things
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
go
 
through,
 
and
 
that's
 
appropriate
 
too.
 
So
 
it's
 
just
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
me
 
kind
 
of
 
looking
 
at
 
everything
 
I
 
have
 
going
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
overhead
 
and
 
see
 
how
 
that
 
will
 
calculate
 
and
 
factor
 
in
 
and
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
it
 
can,
 
you
 
know,
 
totally
 
make
 
sense
 
financially.
 
 
@30:39

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
But
 
definitely
 
the
 
numbers
 
don't
 
seem
 
astronomical
 
as
 
I
 
thought
 
it
 
would
 
have
 
been.
 
Okay.
 
 
@30:43
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Awesome.
 
 
@30:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
because
 
I'll
 
be
 
completely
 
honest
 
with
 
you
 
that
 
these
 
prices
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
taking
 
right
 
now
 
is
 
only
 
because
 
you're
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
first
 
10
 
clients.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
saw
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
my
 
videos
 
or
 
whatever.
 
I've
 
been
 
in
 
this
 
industry
 
for
 
about
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
months
 
now,
 
and
 
I
 
am
 
actually
 
from
 
Israel
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
an
 
agency.
 
I'm
 
working
 
agencies
 
in
 
Israel.
 
I
 
decided
 
to
 
pivot
 
to
 
the
 
US
 
market
 
because
 
this
 
market
 
is
 
booming,
 
and
 
I
 
also
 
have
 
a
 
story
 
with
 
my
 
friend,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you've
 
watched
 
my
 
Instagram,
 
I
 
explained
 
everything
 
there.
 
It's
 
a
 
video
 
with
 
17,000
 
views,
 
you
 
can
 
go
 
watch
 
it
 
after.
 
basically,
 
my
 
friend
 
with
 
antidepressants
 
completely
 
changed,
 
he's
 
hooked
 
on
 
the
 
antidepressants,
 
he's
 
addicted
 
to
 
weed,
 
not
 
the
 
same
 
person
 
anymore.
 
And
 
I
 
had
 
an
 
obsession
 
with
 
psychedelics,
 
with
 
mushrooms,
 
but
 
obviously,
 
it's
 
not
 
very
 
legal
 
yet
 
in
 
the
 
US.
 
And
 
I
 
stumbled
 
across
 
ketamine,
 
and
 
I'm
 
understood
 
it
 
has
 
therapeutic
 
benefits,
 
like
 
people
 
actually
 
use
 
it
 
to
 
treat
 
mental
 
conditions,
 
and
 
they
 
help
 
people
 
like
 
get
 
off
 
antidepressants.
 
 
@31:37
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
holy
 
,
 
this
 
is
 
amazing.
 
 
@31:39
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
let's
 
see
 
what
 
the
 
market,
 
so
 
let's
 
see
 
how
 
the
 
market
 
is
 
in
 
here.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
that's,
 
that's
 
basically
 
how
 
I
 
pivoted.
 
Yeah,
 
these
 
astronomical
 
numbers,
 
like
 
there's
 
other
 
agencies
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
know
 
of,
 
they
 
take
 
insane,
 
like
 
$5,000
 
a
 
month
 
retainers.
 
And
 
it's,
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
get
 
there
 
at
 
one
 
point.
 
 
@31:58
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
But
 
yeah,
 
you're
 
just
 
one
 
of
 
the,
 
you're
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
pioneers
 
here.
 
 
@32:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
you,
 
I
 
want
 
to,
 
again,
 
get
 
people,
 
create
 
the
 
best
 
product
 
on
 
the
 
market,
 
get
 
feedback
 
from
 
you,
 
and
 
then
 
from
 
there,
 
you
 
know,
 
expose
 
what
 
we,
 
you
 
know,
 
raise
 
the
 
price
 
and
 
do
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
where
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to,
 
like,
 
where
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
it
 
from
 
here?
 
 
@32:16
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do?
 
So
 
definitely
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
touch
 
bases
 
with
 
my
 
coordinator
 
that
 
I
 
usually
 
do
 
all
 
of
 
the,
 
my
 
finances
 
and
 
stuff
 
with
 
and
 
see,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
she
 
looks
 
at
 
it.
 
Cause
 
she
 
kind
 
of
 
helps
 
me
 
with
 
the
 
whole
 
marketing
 
piece.
 
She
 
just
 
doesn't
 
have
 
that
 
time,
 
but
 
she's
 
like,
 
she's
 
trying
 
to
 
like
 
kind
 
of
 
streamline
 
things
 
for
 
me
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
because
 
I'm
 
transitioning
 
into
 
doing
 
things
 
on
 
my
 
own,
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
my
 
private
 
practice
 
with
 
the
 
other
 
psychiatric
 
MP
 
there,
 
and
 
I'm
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
doing
 
the
 
ketamine
 
on
 
my
 
own
 
itself.
 
So
 
everything's
 
kind
 
of
 
getting
 
up
 
and
 
running.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
get
 
going.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
touch
 
bases
 
with
 
her,
 
see
 
what
 
she
 
thinks
 
about
 
it.
 
 
@32:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
that's
 
pretty
 
much
 
it.
 
Okay.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
is
 
there
 
anything
 
you
 
need
 
for
 
me?
 
I
 
can
 
send
 
you
 
a
 
call
 
recording
 
the
 
summary
 
of
 
our
 
call,
 
like
 
all
 
the
 
numbers
 
that
 
we
 
went
 
through,
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
help
 
you
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
have
 
the
 
easiest
 
way
 
to
 
get
 
this
 
going.
 
 
@33:01
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
Just
 
the
 
summary
 
of
 
like,
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
writing
 
down
 
anything.
 
And
 
I
 
honestly
 
just
 
literally
 
got
 
home
 
from
 
work
 
from
 
last
 
night.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
just
 
reread
 
this
 
stuff
 
over.
 
I've
 
just
 
picked
 
up
 
the
 
big
 
numbers.
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
said
 
the
 
retainer
 
fee
 
initially
 
would
 
be
 
$8.97
 
and
 
you
 
could
 
either
 
do
 
the
 
$1,200
 
a
 
month
 
or
 
you
 
could
 
do
 
the
 
more
 
low-bought,
 
no
 
$1,500
 
a
 
month
 
or
 
the
 
more
 
low-bought
 
one,
 
depending
 
on
 
what's
 
kind
 
of
 
going
 
on.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
see
 
all
 
on
 
paper
 
and
 
then
 
kind
 
of
 
go
 
from
 
there.
 
then
 
for
 
myself,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
written
 
down
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
nothing.
 
I'm
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
just
 
freestyling
 
right
 
now.
 
So
 
I
 
have
 
nothing.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
have
 
another
 
call
 
to
 
jump
 
on
 
after
 
you.
 
 
@33:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@33:33
 
-
 
Belinda
 
Narine
 
And
 
I
 
like
 
that
 
whole
 
AI
 
thing
 
that
 
you're
 
talking
 
about,
 
which
 
is
 
awesome,
 
because
 
I
 
honestly
 
just
 
myself
 
and
 
my
 
sister
 
just
 
actually
 
invested
 
into
 
an
 
AI
 
arbitrage
 
agency
 
to
 
have
 
our
 
own
 
agency
 
to
 
help,
 
you
 
know,
 
companies
 
and
 
industries
 
have
 
an
 
AI
 
agent
 
work
 
for
 
them.
 
So
 
it
 
kind
 
of
 
is
 
something
 
that
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
mix
 
tech
 
and
 
obviously
 
medicine
 
all
 
together.
 
So
 
it's
 
just,
 
it's
 
the
 
wave
 
of
 
the
 
future.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
myself,
 
even
 
though
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
the
 
one
 
to
 
implement
 
it.
 
AI
 
for
 
someone
 
else
 
and
 
that's
 
something.

I
 
could
 
see
 
myself
 
totally
 
going
 
forward
 
with
 
that
 
just
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
saved
 
and
 
the
 
money
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
saved
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
life.

Belinda

Definitely
 
a
 
lot
 
of

Oh,

Okay.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
the
 
call
 
summary.
 
Do

want

do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
touch
 
base
 
with

or

going
 
to
 
send
 
me
 
a
 
message
 
like

I
 
know
 
I
 
have.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
out
 
of
 
town
 
this
 
weekend.
 
had
 
an
 
unfortunate
 
death
 
on
 
the
 
family.
 
So
 
I'll
 
definitely
 
be
 
leaving
 
on
 
today's
 
Monday.
 
I'm
 
leaving
 
on
 
Wednesday
 
evening.
 
I'll
 
be
 
back
 
on
 
Saturday
 
morning.
 
So
 
I
 
should
 
definitely
 
have
 
an
 
answer
 
with
 
you
 
before
 
I
 
leave.
 
If
 
not,
 
worst
 
case,
 
I'm
 
going
 
look
 
at
 
it
 
like
 
Saturday
 
morning.

Okay.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
call
 
summary.
 
Go
 
over
 
it.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
If
 
she
 
also
 
wants
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call,
 
talk
 
about
 
numbers,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
here.
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
problem
 
going
 
over
 
everything
 
again.
 
And,
 
yeah,
 
awesome.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
call
 
summary.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
Just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
the
 
process
 
will
 
go
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
decide
 
to
 
continue.
 
If
 
you
 
do
 
the
 
second
 
thing.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
an
 
agreement.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
agreement,
 
see
 
that
 
everything's
 
fine
 
with
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
After
 
that,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
–
 
there's
 
an
 
onboarding
 
process.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
fill
 
out
 
an
 
onboarding
 
form.
 
Then
 
you
 
have
 
like
 
five
 
to
 
seven
 
steps
 
to
 
take
 
in
 
the
 
onboarding
 
form.
 
If
 
you
 
cannot
 
complete
 
these
 
steps
 
on
 
your
 
own,
 
we
 
have
 
another
 
call
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
days
 
later
 
in
 
which
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
everything,
 
close
 
out
 
all
 
the
 
little
 
corners.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
explain
 
to
 
you.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
CRM
 
that
 
we
 
use.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
a
 
training
 
on
 
that
 
CRM.
 
We're
 
going
 
have
 
calls
 
on
 
it
 
if
 
you
 
need.
 
So
 
basically,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
–
 
like
 
getting
 
–
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
train.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
trained
 
in
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
one
 
to
 
two
 
weeks
 
on
 
the
 
whole
 
process
 
and
 
the
 
whole
 
way
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
working.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
know
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
time
 
and
 
energy
 
consuming
 
because
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
going
 
towards,
 
okay?
 
Okay.
 
And
 
we
 
plan
 
from
 
the
 
moment
 
that
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
setup
 
fee
 
paid,
 
we
 
plan
 
to
 
go
 
live
 
within
 
seven
 
to
 
ten
 
business
 
days.
 
So
 
just
 
have
 
a
 
timeline
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
