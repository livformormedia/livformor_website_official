This
 
meeting
 
is
 
being
 
recorded.
 
Hi
 
there,
 
Debra.
 
How's
 
it
 
going?
 
I
 
hope
 
you
 
can
 
hear
 
me.

Let's
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can.
 
How's
 
that?

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Is
 
that
 
better?
 
Yes,
 
I
 
can
 
hear
 
you.

Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
How's
 
it

Good.
 
How
 
about

Great,
 
great.
 
So,
 
again,
 
I'm
 
extremely
 
excited
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
you
 
because
 
of
 
psilocybin
 
itself.
 
It's
 
very,
 
very
 
rare
 
that
 
I
 
get
 
psilocybin
 
clinic
 
owners
 
or
 
practitioners.
 
And
 
I
 
believe
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
psilocybin
 
is
 
the
 
revolution
 
of
 
mental
 
health.
 
It
 
is
 
the
 
revolution.
 
So,
 
I'm
 
extremely
 
excited
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
get
 
this
 
revolution
 
going
 
because
 
that's
 
my
 
goal
 
here.
 
I'm
 
in
 
Israel.
 
It's
 
not
 
legal
 
yet,
 
but
 
it
 
isn't
 
trials
 
because
 
of
 
PTSD
 
and
 
everything
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
the
 
war.
 
So
 
they're
 
really
 
testing
 
that
 
out
 
now.
 
1:08
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
So
 
it's
 
interesting
 
because
 
Israel
 
was
 
far
 
ahead
 
of
 
us
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
marijuana
 
also.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
thought
 
that's
 
interesting
 
coincidence
 
that
 
that's
 
where
 
you're
 
at.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
now
 
we're
 
talking
 
about
 
psilocybin.
 
And
 
so
 
my
 
guess
 
is
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
guys
 
will
 
do
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
research
 
and
 
it'll
 
come
 
back
 
really
 
positive
 
and
 
you'll
 
still
 
be
 
way
 
ahead
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
in
 
regards
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
legalizing
 
it
 
there
 
in
 
an
 
effective
 
way.
 
1:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
extremely
 
surprised
 
that
 
when
 
I
 
saw
 
it
 
because
 
I
 
saw
 
an
 
article
 
the
 
other
 
day
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
extremely
 
surprised
 
because
 
like
 
even
 
marijuana
 
is
 
not
 
legal
 
here.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
psychedelic
 
that
 
Schedule
 
1
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
legal.
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
that's
 
unbelievable.
 
1:56
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
So,
 
well,
 
we'll
 
see
 
what
 
happens.
 
I,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
whole.
 
You
 
know,
 
in
 
regards
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
government
 
suppression
 
of
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
entheogens,
 
not
 
just
 
psilocybin,
 
but,
 
you
 
know,
 
to
 
date,
 
between
 
the
 
60s
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
through
 
everything
 
that's
 
been,
 
you
 
know,
 
recorded
 
up,
 
you
 
know,
 
for
 
the
 
last,
 
you
 
know,
 
40
 
years,
 
there
 
have
 
been
 
zero
 
deaths,
 
zero
 
overdoses.
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
can't
 
possibly
 
make
 
it
 
a
 
Schedule
 
1
 
drug
 
because
 
there's
 
nothing.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it
 
is
 
truly
 
one
 
of
 
the,
 
if
 
not
 
the
 
safest
 
entheogen.
 
And
 
so
 
I'm
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
I'm
 
somewhat
 
perplexed
 
that
 
the
 
campaign
 
in
 
regards
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
what's
 
happened.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
have
 
little
 
pockets
 
here,
 
obviously,
 
in
 
Colorado
 
and
 
in
 
Seattle,
 
Washington.
 
And
 
all
 
of
 
Oregon
 
Oregon
 
has.
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
I've
 
been
 
doing
 
this
 
for
 
eight
 
years,
 
really
 
underground.
 
And
 
so,
 
and
 
so
 
but
 
now,
 
and
 
it
 
used
 
to
 
be
 
that
 
you
 
could
 
use
 
the
 
word
 
entheogen,
 
or
 
you
 
could
 
say
 
plant
 
medicine,
 
you
 
could
 
do
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
things.
 
As
 
of
 
last
 
year,
 
you
 
can't,
 
Google
 
won't
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
use
 
any
 
of
 
those
 
words.
 
Now,
 
big
 
companies,
 
if
 
you're
 
dropping
 
$100,000
 
a
 
month
 
into
 
Google,
 
apparently,
 
they
 
take
 
a,
 
it's
 
a
 
real
 
blind
 
eye
 
at
 
that
 
point.
 
So.
 
I
 
you
 
advertise
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
list
 
of
 
those
 
that
 
are
 
sponsored
 
pages
 
that
 
are
 
on
 
Google,
 
and
 
it's
 
very
 
interesting,
 
you
 
know,
 
they
 
talk
 
about
 
psilocybin
 
and
 
psilocybin
 
retreats
 
and
 
psilocybin
 
in
 
clinical,
 
and
 
I
 
just
 
think,
 
oh,
 
my
 
God,
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
get
 
away
 
with
 
that?
 
Because
 
I
 
can't
 
seem
 
to
 
run
 
a
 
single
 
ad
 
that
 
even
 
hints
 
at
 
what
 
it
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
do,
 
so
 
it's
 
perplexing,
 
and
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
reached
 
out
 
to
 
you
 
when
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
ad
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
marijuana
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
helping
 
dispensaries,
 
you
 
know,
 
get
 
a
 
leverage,
 
get
 
a
 
foothold
 
in
 
that.
 
4:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
So
 
I
 
didn't
 
have
 
an
 
ad
 
about
 
marijuana.
 
I'm
 
wondering
 
which
 
ad
 
you
 
came
 
from
 
because
 
there
 
was
 
two
 
ads
 
that's
 
running
 
right
 
now.
 
One
 
is
 
there's
 
a
 
video
 
ad
 
of
 
me
 
going
 
over
 
the
 
belief
 
bridge
 
method,
 
which
 
is
 
that
 
one
 
ad,
 
and
 
there's
 
another.
 
Which
 
is
 
showing
 
the
 
brain
 
scans,
 
like
 
to
 
not
 
use
 
the
 
brain
 
scan
 
ad.
 
5:05
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Maybe
 
it
 
was
 
the
 
brain
 
scan
 
ad.
 
5:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
was
 
probably
 
the
 
brain
 
scan
 
ad
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
talking
 
about
 
Myrana.
 
Anyways,
 
so
 
yeah,
 
Google
 
is
 
problematic.
 
Google
 
are
 
very
 
problematic.
 
Honestly,
 
do
 
not
 
advertise
 
on
 
Google
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
problems
 
that
 
they
 
do.
 
Also,
 
they
 
have
 
unbelievable
 
click
 
fraud.
 
And
 
besides
 
that,
 
this
 
type
 
of
 
product
 
needs
 
education.
 
And
 
because
 
it
 
needs
 
education,
 
it
 
means
 
it
 
needs
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
more
 
people
 
that
 
don't
 
understand
 
what
 
it
 
does
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
works.
 
There's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
misconceptions
 
and
 
limiting
 
beliefs
 
and
 
things
 
that
 
people
 
do
 
not
 
know.
 
In
 
which
 
we
 
can
 
basically
 
break
 
these
 
limiting
 
beliefs
 
and
 
show
 
them
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
heal
 
and
 
it's
 
possible.
 
Because
 
it
 
is
 
possible.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
would
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
bit
 
like
 
you
 
tried
 
advertising
 
on
 
Google?
 
Did
 
you
 
try
 
anything?
 
Did
 
you
 
try
 
Facebook?
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
landing
 
page
 
as
 
well.
 
Did
 
you
 
try
 
anything
 
else
 
besides
 
that?
 
6:06
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
have
 
an
 
ad
 
now
 
on
 
Google
 
where
 
it's
 
a
 
woman
 
that's
 
winking
 
and
 
she
 
said,
 
it
 
just
 
says
 
healing
 
retreat
 
up
 
at
 
the
 
top
 
and
 
then
 
at
 
the
 
bottom
 
because
 
it
 
says,
 
because
 
Google
 
won't
 
let
 
us
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
we
 
really
 
do.
 
And
 
they
 
approved
 
that
 
ad.
 
So
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
that
 
was
 
completely
 
vanilla.
 
So
 
that
 
landing
 
page
 
is
 
conscious
 
expansion.
 
That's
 
that
 
landing
 
page
 
is.
 
Because
 
my
 
plant
 
medicine
 
page,
 
because
 
it
 
says
 
plant
 
medicine
 
on
 
it,
 
I
 
can't
 
get
 
anything
 
through
 
Facebook
 
either.
 
6:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Wow.
 
6:48
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
conscious
 
expansion
 
allows
 
me
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
get
 
that
 
ad
 
out.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
another
 
ad
 
that
 
basically
 
says
 
it'll
 
be.
 
It'll
 
be
 
a
 
little
 
different.
 
Instead
 
of
 
a
 
wink,
 
it'll
 
be
 
a
 
whisper.
 
You
 
know,
 
it'll
 
be
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
that
 
says,
 
Google
 
won't
 
let
 
us
 
use
 
the
 
P
 
word.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
some
 
traction
 
with
 
that,
 
too.
 
7:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
interesting.
 
So,
 
so,
 
okay,
 
so
 
basically
 
people
 
search
 
up,
 
you
 
think
 
people
 
search
 
up
 
psilocybin
 
retreats
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
understand?
 
7:22
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Okay.
 
Psilocybin
 
and
 
the
 
word
 
microdosing,
 
microdosing
 
from
 
last
 
year
 
to
 
this
 
year,
 
just
 
the
 
word
 
microdosing
 
is
 
up
 
1,250%.
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
we
 
have,
 
there's,
 
there's
 
a
 
handful
 
of
 
companies.
 
One
 
is
 
called
 
Mama
 
Dose
 
that
 
actually
 
does
 
microdosing
 
well.
 
Uh,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
product
 
that
 
they're
 
selling
 
all
 
over
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
and
 
still
 
haven't
 
been
 
shut
 
down.
 
Um,
 
they're
 
unable
 
to
 
run
 
ads
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
I
 
know
 
them,
 
um,
 
you
 
know,
 
because
 
I've
 
talked
 
to
 
them
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
times.
 
They're
 
unable
 
to.
 
They
 
ads
 
on
 
Facebook
 
at
 
all,
 
and
 
what
 
they
 
do
 
is
 
they
 
just
 
change
 
their
 
landing
 
page
 
every
 
two
 
weeks,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
run
 
another
 
ad
 
until
 
they're
 
caught,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
run
 
another
 
landing
 
page.
 
But
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
money
 
behind
 
them,
 
and
 
they're
 
making
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
money,
 
and
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
afford
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
as
 
a
 
nonprofit.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
can't
 
match
 
that.
 
8:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
understand.
 
So
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
results
 
up
 
until
 
now?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
past
 
month,
 
two
 
months?
 
8:33
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
I
 
don't
 
yet.
 
My
 
call
 
to
 
you,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
SEO
 
guy
 
that
 
I've
 
worked
 
with
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
UK
 
for
 
the
 
last
 
10
 
years,
 
and
 
he's
 
compiling
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
stuff
 
for
 
me,
 
and
 
we're
 
trying
 
something
 
a
 
little
 
different
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
keywords
 
and
 
some
 
blogging,
 
long
 
tail
 
keywords,
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
any
 
headway.
 
Last
 
year
 
we
 
did
 
okay.
 
I
 
consider
 
we
 
moved.
 
We've
 
moved.
 
We've
 
We
 
Texas
 
to
 
Washington
 
State,
 
so
 
we're
 
back
 
in
 
the
 
Pacific
 
Northwest,
 
which
 
is
 
nice,
 
for
 
all
 
the
 
right
 
reasons,
 
and
 
we
 
were
 
all
 
born
 
and
 
raised
 
in
 
the
 
Pacific
 
Northwest,
 
and
 
Texas
 
is,
 
it's
 
a
 
different
 
atmosphere,
 
we'll
 
just
 
put
 
it
 
that
 
way,
 
and
 
so
 
we
 
moved
 
back,
 
last
 
year
 
was,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
I
 
considered
 
to
 
be,
 
we've
 
been
 
here
 
four
 
years,
 
last
 
year
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
considered
 
my
 
start
 
year,
 
and
 
we
 
did
 
$49,000.
 
This
 
year,
 
it
 
was
 
like
 
the
 
rug
 
was
 
pulled
 
out,
 
we
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
the
 
economy,
 
and
 
tariffs,
 
and
 
people
 
are
 
scared
 
here
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
happen,
 
or,
 
or
 
exactly
 
what,
 
but
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
been
 
brutal.
 
So,
 
again,
 
that's
 
why.
 
So,
 
why.
 
You
 
know,
 
we're
 
trying
 
to
 
sort
 
it
 
out,
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
data,
 
to
 
see
 
where
 
we're
 
at.

Okay,
 
so
 
this
 
year
 
has
 
been
 
as
 
good
 
as
 
last
 
year?
 
10:10
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah,
 
brutal.
 
Brutal.
 
We
 
were
 
on
 
track
 
last
 
year,
 
I
 
thought,
 
to
 
double
 
the
 
money.
 
I
 
really
 
did.
 
You
 
would
 
have
 
never,
 
in
 
a
 
hundred
 
years,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
I've
 
been
 
doing
 
this
 
for
 
a
 
long
 
time.
 
You'd
 
have
 
never
 
convinced
 
me
 
with
 
the
 
strong,
 
again,
 
proponent
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
for
 
psilocybin
 
to
 
become
 
legalized
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
search
 
results
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
you
 
know,
 
we've
 
ran,
 
we've
 
done
 
comparisons
 
to
 
all
 
of
 
our,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
say,
 
you
 
know,
 
competitors
 
per
 
se.
 
And
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
still
 
just,
 
yeah,
 
we've
 
done
 
geo
 
marketing
 
for
 
targeting
 
for
 
micro
 
dosing
 
and
 
for
 
psilocybin
 
for,
 
you
 
know,
 
psychedelic.
 
Quote,
 
unquote,
 
retreats
 
to
 
300
 
of
 
the
 
top
 
cities.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
get
 
about
 
25
 
or
 
30
 
email
 
signups
 
a
 
day,
 
or
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
a
 
week,
 
about
 
30
 
a
 
week.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
we're
 
just,
 
they're
 
just
 
absolutely
 
not
 
converting.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
it's
 
not
 
because
 
of
 
lack
 
of,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
have
 
great
 
reviews.
 
I
 
mean,
 
we're
 
literally
 
five
 
star
 
reviews.
 
And
 
I'm
 
just,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
I'm
 
perplexed.
 
Again,
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
reached
 
out.
 
11:40

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
patterns
 
that
 
you
 
notice
 
when
 
people
 
not
 
convert?
 
Is
 
there
 
something
 
specific
 
that
 
they
 
say
 
something
 
they
 
repeat
 
again
 
and
 
again
 
on
 
the
 
calls?
 
11:49
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
They
 
don't.
 
You
 
know,
 
we
 
put
 
on
 
a,
 
you
 
know,
 
on
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
my
 
welcoming
 
email.
 
I
 
actually
 
have
 
a
 
link
 
to
 
Mama
 
Doe.
 
So
 
for
 
to
 
microdose
 
psilocybin,
 
because
 
I
 
really
 
do
 
believe
 
in
 
microdosing.
 
I
 
really
 
believe
 
it
 
changes
 
brain
 
structure.
 
In
 
the
 
last
 
six
 
months,
 
I've
 
sent
 
them
 
$13,000
 
worth
 
of
 
business.
 
12:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
okay.
 
And
 
how
 
does
 
it
 
affect
 
you,
 
though?
 
12:22
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
That's
 
the
 
question.
 
Exactly.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's,
 
I
 
have
 
some
 
dilemma
 
about
 
that.
 
Morally,
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
the
 
right
 
thing
 
to
 
do.
 
But
 
again,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
because
 
it's
 
a
 
smaller,
 
I
 
mean,
 
we're
 
only
 
charging
 
$1,500
 
for
 
three
 
days,
 
and
 
we're
 
all
 
inclusive.
 
So
 
you
 
get
 
lodging
 
and
 
food.
 
And
 
I
 
mean,
 
and
 
it's
 
great.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it's,
 
it's
 
great
 
food.
 
So
 
we're
 
not
 
serving
 
peanut
 
butter
 
and
 
jelly
 
sandwiches
 
at
 
lunch.
 
Michael
 
is
 
a
 
trained
 
chef.
 
And
 
I'm
 
not
 
too
 
bad
 
in
 
the
 
kitchen,
 
either.
 
mean,
 
are
 
other
 
the
 
I
 
We're
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
here,
 
but
 
the
 
interesting
 
thing
 
is,
 
obviously,
 
if
 
you're
 
microdosing
 
psilocybin,
 
it's
 
a
 
small
 
ticket
 
item.
 
People
 
are
 
spending
 
$150
 
to
 
$250,
 
and
 
of
 
course,
 
three
 
days
 
here
 
is
 
$1,500.
 
So
 
there's
 
a
 
big
 
gap
 
between
 
the
 
two.
 
13:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
all
 
comes
 
down
 
to
 
a
 
need.
 
And
 
a
 
question
 
of,
 
when
 
you
 
hop
 
with
 
people
 
on
 
the
 
call,
 
do
 
you
 
identify
 
their
 
need?
 
Analyze
 
what
 
they
 
need?
 
What's
 
the
 
situation
 
that
 
they're
 
at
 
right
 
now?
 
And
 
understanding,
 
okay,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
deal
 
with?
 
What
 
are
 
your
 
struggles?
 
Based
 
on
 
that,
 
knowing
 
how
 
to
 
direct
 
them.
 
The
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
do
 
morally,
 
that's
 
great
 
for
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
not,
 
for
 
example,
 
dealing
 
with
 
depression
 
or
 
have
 
trauma
 
or
 
PTSD.
 
Yeah,
 
they
 
can
 
use
 
microdosing.
 
I'm
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
microdosing
 
myself.
 
anxiety
 
threat.
 
I'm
 
from
 
you
 
an
 
14:00
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Good
 
for
 
you.
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
with
 
it.
 
Can
 
I
 
ask
 
you,
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
get
 
it
 
from,
 
I
 
mean,
 
is
 
there
 
somebody,
 
you
 
have
 
somebody
 
privately.
 
14:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Excellent.
 
14:10
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Exactly.
 
And
 
I
 
will
 
tell
 
you,
 
can
 
I
 
ask
 
you
 
what
 
strain
 
that
 
you're
 
thinking
 
about?
 
14:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
whether
 
it's
 
a
 
golden
 
teacher
 
or
 
there's
 
a,
 
there's
 
a
 
one
 
that's,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
non,
 
one
 
that's
 
even
 
like
 
weaker
 
or
 
gentler,
 
white,
 
something
 
white.
 
14:28
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
White
 
buffalo.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
think,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
the
 
one.
 
will,
 
I
 
will
 
tell
 
you,
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
strains,
 
golden
 
teacher,
 
it
 
produces
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
amazing
 
brain
 
chemistry
 
and
 
gives
 
you
 
that
 
direct
 
connection
 
to
 
the
 
God
 
divine
 
of
 
your
 
understanding,
 
as
 
does
 
envy.
 
The
 
other
 
ones,
 
unless
 
you're
 
very
 
careful,
 
the
 
write
 
up
 
can
 
cause
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
anxiety.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
PTSD,
 
those
 
crebenzas.
 
Yes.
 
Yes.
 
Yes.
 
Produce
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
that
 
anxiety,
 
and
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
want
 
to
 
avoid
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
kind
 
of
 
anxiousness
 
at
 
all,
 
because
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about,
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about,
 
yeah,
 
teeth
 
clenching,
 
shaking
 
kind
 
of
 
sweat
 
kind
 
of
 
thing.
 
You
 
don't
 
want
 
that
 
for
 
people
 
with
 
PTSD
 
and
 
trauma,
 
and
 
so
 
just
 
know
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
my
 
speech
 
about
 
throwing
 
all
 
psilocybin
 
into
 
a
 
pill
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
taking,
 
and
 
each
 
psilocybin
 
mushroom
 
has
 
a
 
different
 
effect,
 
and
 
a
 
different
 
effect
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
that
 
structure
 
in
 
your
 
brain,
 
but
 
also
 
a
 
different
 
effect
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
the
 
write-up,
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
call
 
it,
 
the
 
write-up
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
there.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
experienced
 
you
 
are,
 
but
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
strains
 
can
 
produce
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
anxiety
 
before
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
kind
 
of
 
visual
 
or
 
any
 
kind
 
16:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
only
 
did
 
it
 
once.
 
It
 
was
 
actually
 
a
 
month
 
ago
 
on
 
my
 
girlfriend's
 
birthday,
 
which
 
was
 
a
 
day
 
before
 
mine
 
in
 
Amsterdam.
 
And
 
we
 
took
 
truffles
 
because
 
it's
 
not
 
legal
 
in
 
Amsterdam.
 
And
 
it
 
was
 
unbelievable.
 
But
 
then
 
I
 
made
 
a
 
mistake
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
knew
 
to
 
not
 
sorry
 
for
 
saying
 
that
 
not
 
the
 
mushrooms.
 
And
 
I
 
did
 
with
 
the
 
mushrooms
 
because
 
we
 
took
 
we
 
took
 
an
 
equivalent
 
of
 
1.5
 
grams
 
and
 
truffles.
 
And
 
it
 
was
 
unbelievable.
 
16:32
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
We're
 
in
 
the
 
park
 
on
 
like
 
amazing.
 
16:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
got
 
to
 
I
 
got
 
extremely
 
emotional
 
as
 
well.
 
My
 
dad
 
and
 
everything.
 
He
 
passed
 
and
 
it
 
was
 
like,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
it
 
was
 
unbelievable.
 
And
 
at
 
night,
 
we're
 
like,
 
let's
 
take
 
some
 
more
 
at
 
night.
 
Big
 
mistake.
 
16:51
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Big,
 
big
 
mistake.
 
16:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
I
 
got
 
an
 
unbelievable
 
amount
 
of
 
anxiety
 
out
 
of
 
nowhere.
 
I
 
was
 
completely
 
fine.
 
Then
 
I
 
shut
 
Boom.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
where
 
it
 
happened.
 
So,
 
and
 
that
 
was
 
like,
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
wow,
 
that's,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
should,
 
I
 
knew
 
I
 
shouldn't
 
have
 
done
 
that,
 
but
 
I
 
still
 
did
 
that.
 
But
 
I'm
 
glad
 
I
 
experienced
 
that
 
on
 
my
 
flesh,
 
to
 
know
 
to
 
not
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
anymore.
 
17:13
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
So
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
counsel
 
other
 
people.
 
And
 
it's
 
yeah.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
do
 
things
 
like
 
that.
 
And
 
you're
 
right.
 
There's
 
a
 
certain
 
honoring
 
the
 
plant
 
and
 
the
 
consciousness
 
of
 
the
 
mushroom
 
itself,
 
and
 
the
 
spirit.
 
And
 
when
 
we
 
step
 
over
 
that
 
boundary,
 
again,
 
we're
 
taught
 
a
 
lesson,
 
sometimes
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
uncomfortable
 
lesson.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
but
 
that
 
experience
 
for
 
you.
 
Then
 
shows
 
you
 
what
 
that
 
anxiety
 
is
 
like.
 
So
 
that
 
when
 
you
 
go
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
other
 
people
 
about
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
psilocybin
 
and
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
mushrooms,
 
you
 
now
 
have
 
it
 
down,
 
you
 
know,
 
exactly
 
what
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about.
 
Mm
 
hmm.
 
17:58
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It
 
reminded
 
me
 
of.
 
Of
 
my
 
little
 
kid
 
anxiety.
 
Because
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
a
 
kid,
 
I
 
had
 
this
 
uncontrollable
 
wave
 
type
 
anxiety
 
where
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
extremely
 
anxious,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
would
 
go
 
down
 
and
 
then
 
would
 
just
 
come
 
back
 
up.
 
It
 
was
 
exactly
 
like
 
that
 
for
 
like
 
two
 
hours,
 
two
 
hours.
 
And
 
was
 
like,
 
right
 
when
 
it
 
switched
 
to
 
my
 
birthday.
 
Just
 
it
 
was
 
not
 
nice
 
at
 
all.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
glad
 
I'm
 
glad
 
I
 
experienced
 
that.
 
And
 
I'm
 
glad
 
I
 
also
 
experienced
 
a
 
very
 
bright
 
side
 
of
 
it
 
because
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
so
 
nervous.
 
And
 
it
 
was
 
unbelievable.
 
And
 
I
 
just
 
cannot
 
wait
 
to
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
happen
 
when
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
with
 
a
 
therapist
 
in
 
a
 
controlled
 
environment
 
and
 
take
 
a
 
hero
 
dose
 
and
 
you
 
know,
 
really
 
tackle
 
some
 
trauma
 
that
 
I
 
probably
 
have
 
inside
 
me.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
just
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
share
 
about
 
that.
 
Anyways,
 
so
 
you're
 
currently
 
only
 
running
 
on
 
Google,
 
we
 
get
 
30
 
people
 
a
 
week,
 
which
 
is,
 
it's
 
a
 
nice
 
number.
 
It's
 
a
 
nice
 
number.
 
It's
 
really.
 
Nice
 
number.
 
And
 
none
 
of
 
them
 
convert?
 
19:02
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Not
 
even
 
a
 
single
 
one
 
a
 
week?
 
Nope.
 
19:09

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Do
 
you
 
direct
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
into
 
Mama
 
Dose?
 
19:15

Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
There's
 
a
 
thing
 
on
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
page.
 
So
 
basically,
 
it
 
goes
 
through
 
what
 
our
 
schedule
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be.
 
And
 
there's
 
a
 
little
 
intro
 
about
 
who
 
I
 
am.
 
The
 
one,
 
the
 
welcome
 
page,
 
the
 
welcome
 
email
 
that
 
I
 
did
 
before
 
talked
 
about
 
the
 
legalities.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
basically,
 
you
 
didn't
 
have
 
to
 
worry
 
about
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
being
 
rated
 
because
 
we
 
only
 
take
 
five
 
people
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
on
 
a
 
weekend.
 
It's
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
party
 
atmosphere
 
at
 
all.
 
And
 
we
 
didn't
 
convert
 
with
 
any
 
of
 
that
 
change
 
the
 
email
 
up.
 
Thought,
 
oh,
 
we'll
 
try
 
something
 
different
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
convert
 
with
 
that.
 
So
 
I,
 
I'm,
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
I'm
 
perplexed.
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
there.

Well,
 
they
 
have
 
the

to
 
call
 
me,
 
my

is
 
literally
 
on

You
 
can
 
call
 
me,
 
you
 
can
 
text
 
me.
 
And
 
there's
 
not
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
that
 
going
 
on,
 
I
 
might
 
get
 
one
 
or
 
two,
 
what
 
I
 
call
 
looky-loos
 
over
 
the

of

Okay,
 
so
 
I
 
understand
 
the
 
bottleneck.
 
I
 
answered
 
way
 
better
 
now.
 
The
 
main
 
challenge
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
right
 
now
 
is
 
trying
 
to
 
sell
 
a
 
$1,500
 
product
 
before
 
people
 
even
 
got
 
on
 
the
 
phone
 
with
 
you
 
and
 
understood
 
who
 
you
 
are.

That

Have
 
a

in
 
which
 
you

Really
 
go

On
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
you
 
can
 
give
 
people
 
the
 
option
 
if...
 
It's
 
possible
 
for
 
you,
 
cash
 
flow-wise,
 
to
 
split
 
it
 
to
 
payments,
 
to
 
be
 
easier.
 
That's
 
another
 
thing,
 
to
 
reduce
 
friction.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
key
 
things
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
focus
 
on,
 
because
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
conversion
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
landing
 
page,
 
what
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
just
 
dial
 
in
 
the
 
follow-up
 
process
 
and
 
dial
 
in
 
the
 
whole
 
identification
 
phase
 
and
 
the
 
closing
 
phase.
 
Because
 
selling
 
a
 
$1,500
 
product
 
from
 
an
 
email,
 
that's
 
basically
 
impossible
 
in
 
today's
 
world.
 
Especially
 
for
 
something
 
that's
 
very...
 
Imagine
 
that
 
people
 
that
 
sign
 
up,
 
there's
 
probably
 
70-80%
 
of
 
them
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
never
 
been
 
into
 
something
 
like
 
that
 
before.
 
It's
 
completely
 
new
 
to
 
them.
 
So
 
they
 
cannot
 
see
 
the
 
value
 
in
 
paying
 
$1,500
 
for
 
something
 
that
 
they
 
don't
 
understand
 
what
 
it
 
even
 
does.
 
And
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
they're
 
scared,
 
they
 
have
 
uncertainty,
 
and
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
create
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
for
 
them.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
create
 
belief,
 
hope,
 
and
 
certainty
 
inside
 
them
 
to
 
make
 
them
 
understand
 
that
 
it's
 
for
 
them,
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
help
 
them.
 
And
 
also
 
create...
 
...
 
...
 
...
 
The
 
most
 
minimum
 
friction
 
possible,
 
and
 
you
 
create
 
that
 
by
 
talking
 
to
 
them
 
on
 
the
 
phone,
 
or
 
Zoom,
 
or
 
if
 
they're
 
in
 
your
 
city,
 
or
 
in
 
your
 
area,
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
you,
 
to
 
your
 
house.
 
Sit
 
down
 
and
 
talk
 
to
 
them.

Believe
 
it
 
or
 
not,
 
most
 
of
 
my
 
people
 
that
 
I
 
get
 
fly
 
from
 
the
 
East
 
Coast
 
here.
 
So
 
it's
 
four
 
or
 
five
 
hours.
 
I
 
get
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
from
 
New
 
York,
 
which
 
is,
 
I
 
find
 
fascinating.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why.
 
23:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
think,
 
and
 
yeah,
 
New
 
York
 
is
 
really
 
interesting.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can
 
understand
 
why,
 
because
 
New
 
York
 
is,
 
I've
 
been
 
there
 
once,
 
and
 
it's
 
a
 
hectic
 
place,
 
unbelievably
 
hectic
 
place.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
understand
 
why
 
people
 
would
 
look
 
for
 
solutions.
 
They're
 
also,
 
they
 
have
 
an
 
interesting
 
vibe
 
there,
 
I
 
guess
 
you
 
could
 
say.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
understand
 
why
 
it
 
happens.
 
But
 
in
 
general,
 
like,
 
talking
 
practical-wise,
 
this
 
is
 
like,
 
definitely
 
the
 
number
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to...
 
So
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
would
 
do
 
instead
 
of
 
you,
 
because
 
you
 
get
 
so
 
many
 
signups
 
from
 
Google,
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
should
 
continue
 
with
 
Google.
 
don't
 
know
 
if,
 
is
 
it
 
organic
 
or
 
in
 
Google,
 
like
 
an
 
ads
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
just,
 
okay,
 
so
 
it's
 
both
 
of
 
them.
 
Oh,
 
it's
 
organic.
 
24:14
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
It's
 
not
 
even
 
ads.
 
24:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No.
 
Okay.
 
24:17
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
That's
 
amazing.
 
No,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
try
 
ads
 
this
 
next
 
week.
 
Again,
 
with
 
the,
 
you
 
know,
 
Google
 
won't
 
let
 
us
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
we
 
really
 
do.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
get.
 
24:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
creative.
 
I
 
like
 
that.
 
And
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
with
 
Facebook,
 
actually.
 
Okay.
 
Facebook
 
is
 
a
 
song
 
tool
 
when
 
you
 
use
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
way.
 
And
 
what
 
do
 
I
 
mean
 
the
 
right
 
way?
 
Facebook.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
theory
 
about
 
Facebook
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
less
 
tools
 
to
 
actually
 
scan
 
video
 
ads.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
that
 
gives
 
you
 
all
 
the
 
advantages
 
possible
 
because
 
you
 
can
 
talk
 
more
 
freely.
 
People
 
can
 
see
 
you
 
and
 
get
 
to
 
connect
 
to
 
you
 
more.
 
Okay.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
You
 
have
 
more
 
real
 
estate
 
because
 
you
 
show
 
up
 
in
 
Reels
 
and
 
in
 
Stories
 
and
 
all
 
these
 
places,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
test
 
way
 
more
 
things
 
because
 
with
 
videos,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
looked
 
at
 
my
 
YouTube
 
channel,
 
in
 
I
 
explain
 
how
 
we
 
work
 
with
 
our
 
ads,
 
how
 
we
 
create
 
our
 
ads,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
format
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
test
 
things.
 
We
 
have
 
two
 
body
 
copies,
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
hooks
 
to
 
test
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
video
 
to
 
see
 
which
 
angles
 
work,
 
and
 
we
 
basically
 
see
 
what
 
works
 
with
 
many
 
creatives
 
to
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
not
 
burn
 
out
 
and
 
also
 
see
 
what
 
works
 
best
 
because
 
something
 
isn't
 
going
 
to
 
catch.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
just
 
do
 
it
 
again
 
and
 
again
 
and
 
again.
 
just
 
reiterate
 
and
 
change
 
things.
 
And
 
it's
 
an
 
endless
 
testing
 
process.
 
So
 
we
 
got
 
the
 
best
 
of
 
all
 
worlds.
 
You
 
get
 
more
 
real
 
estate,
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
more
 
testing,
 
Facebook
 
is
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
scan
 
things
 
as
 
well,
 
because
 
you're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
write
 
anything
 
in
 
the
 
ad
 
copy
 
in
 
the
 
text,
 
you're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
write,
 
watch
 
this
 
video
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that,
 
if
 
you're
 
dealing
 
with
 
X,
 
Y,
 
Z,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
direct
 
people
 
to
 
a
 
landing
 
page,
 
they
 
can
 
leave
 
their
 
details
 
and
 
it's
 
the
 
exact
 
same.
 
Also,
 
believe
 
that
 
Facebook
 
is
 
a
 
way
 
stronger
 
vehicle
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
it's
 
educative.
 
It's
 
interrupt
 
marketing,
 
whereas
 
there's
 
people
 
that
 
actively
 
search
 
for
 
psilocybin
 
treatments
 
or
 
psilocybin
 
microdosing
 
or
 
any
 
of
 
that
 
stuff,
 
and
 
there's
 
people
 
that
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
about
 
that.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
like
 
the
 
90%
 
of
 
the
 
market
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
can
 
really
 
help
 
because
 
I've
 
talked
 
about
 
that
 
in
 
my
 
videos
 
as
 
well.
 
Most
 
people
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
help
 
are
 
labeled
 
as
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression
 
patients.

Right.

Oriel
 
Mor

And
 
when
 
you're
 
being
 
labeled
 
like
 
that,
 
it's
 
not
 
just
 
a
 
label.
 
It's
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
your
 
identity.
 
And
 
when
 
that's
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
your
 
identity,
 
you
 
have
 
no
 
hope
 
anymore.
 
Right,
 
I
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
rebuild
 
that
 
hope.
 
Yeah,
 
and
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
rebuild
 
that
 
hope.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
in
 
the
 
marketing.
 
And
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
lot
 
of.
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
agencies
 
in
 
which
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
provide,
 
like
 
provide
 
ketamine
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
they
 
talk
 
about
 
FDA
 
approvals
 
and
 
insurances.
 
And
 
while
 
it's
 
true
 
and
 
nice,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
change
 
anything
 
because
 
SSRIs
 
are
 
also
 
FDA
 
approved
 
and
 
they
 
didn't
 
work,
 
did
 
they?

thing
 
is,
 
again,
 
I
 
find
 
this
 
so
 
interesting.
 
You
 
can
 
take
 
psilocybin
 
and
 
there's
 
zero
 
death
 
rate
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
look
 
up
 
the
 
death
 
rate
 
for
 
SSRIs
 
and
 
it's
 
a
 
staggering
 
number.

Yeah.
 
Also,
 
I
 
got,
 
I
 
saw
 
this
 
graph
 
on
 
Big
 
Think,
 
this
 
YouTube
 
channel
 
in
 
which
 
the,
 
they
 
had
 
a
 
whole
 
list
 
of
 
drugs
 
and
 
their
 
harm
 
to
 
society.
 
Alcohol
 
and
 
heroin
 
were
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
two
 
spots.
 
27:44
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah.

Oriel

It's
 
just,
 
it's
 
mind
 
boggling.
 
Honestly,
 
I
 
just
 
don't
 
understand
 
how
 
a
 
drug
 
like
 
alcohol
 
is
 
just,
 
and
 
also
 
like
 
smoking
 
like
 
cigarettes.
 
It's
 
only
 
because
 
they
 
make
 
so
 
much
 
money.
 
They
 
make
 
so
 
much
 
money
 
and
 
they
 
get.
 
They
 
get
 
what
 
the
 
government
 
wants
 
and
 
it
 
controls
 
people
 
more
 
like
 
it's
 
unfortunate,
 
but
 
we
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
exactly
 
what
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
do.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
tools
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
and
 
that
 
we're
 
discovering
 
that
 
are
 
making
 
a
 
revolution
 
and
 
change.
 
It's
 
basically
 
changing
 
society.
 
It
 
sounds
 
like
 
dramatic
 
and
 
insane,
 
but
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
do.
 
That's
 
what
 
we
 
do.
 
That's
 
the
 
goal
 
here.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
practical
 
wise,
 
everything
 
that
 
I
 
told
 
you
 
right
 
now,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
implement
 
these
 
things,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
an
 
immense
 
improvement
 
in
 
your
 
results,
 
an
 
immense
 
improvement,
 
because
 
usually
 
there's
 
only
 
three,
 
four,
 
five
 
actions
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
take
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
your
 
sales
 
funnel
 
that
 
will
 
dramatically
 
improve
 
your
 
results.
 
You
 
have
 
the
 
organic
 
part
 
cracked,
 
which
 
is
 
great.
 
People
 
are
 
showing
 
intent,
 
which
 
is
 
good.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
improved
 
upon
 
is
 
your
 
selling
 
process
 
and
 
showing
 
how
 
it
 
works
 
can
 
actually
 
communicate
 
in
 
that
 
to
 
people.
 
2
 
When
 
you
 
do
 
that
 
better,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
It's
 
undeniable
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
because
 
there
 
are
 
companies
 
that
 
offer
 
treats
 
and
 
they
 
sell,
 
right?
 
People
 
pay
 
thousands
 
of
 
dollars.
 
29:12
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah,
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
say,
 
yeah,
 
we're
 
the
 
cheapest
 
place
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
right
 
now.
 
29:17

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Exactly
 
that.
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
also
 
what
 
I
 
thought.
 
was
 
like
 
$1,500,
 
that
 
sounds
 
cheap.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
not
 
sure
 
whether
 
to
 
say
 
that
 
or
 
not,
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
treatment,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
company,
 
I
 
don't
 
remember
 
their
 
name,
 
but
 
I'm
 
subscribed
 
to
 
their
 
email
 
list.
 
They
 
do
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
Valley
 
in
 
Peru,
 
the
 
Sacred
 
Valley
 
in
 
Peru.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah,
 
they
 
cost
 
like
 
$4,000.
 
Yeah.

Or,
 
and
 
I'm
 
intrigued,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
there,
 
you
 
know?
 
So,
 
I
 
mean,
 
$1,500
 
is
 
nothing
 
when
 
you
 
communicate
 
the
 
value
 
and
 
the
 
results
 
that
 
they
 
get
 
out
 
of
 
it.
 
You
 
know,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
thing,
 
like
 
the
 
most
 
crucial
 
needle
 
mover
 
is
 
having
 
a
 
Zoom
 
call
 
or
 
a
 
physical,
 
like
 
a
 
physical
 
call
 
with
 
them.
 
that
 
do,
 
In
 
your
 
house,
 
and
 
showing
 
them
 
the
 
presentation,
 
showing
 
them
 
the
 
stats,
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
also
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
should
 
implement,
 
you
 
haven't
 
had
 
many
 
retreats,
 
I'm
 
assuming,
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
couple
 
of
 
months,
 
but
 
in
 
the
 
retreats
 
themselves,
 
film
 
people
 
after
 
the
 
retreat
 
and
 
tell
 
them
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
their
 
experience.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
whole
 
layout
 
of
 
testimonials
 
gathering,
 
which
 
explains
 
what
 
questions
 
to
 
ask,
 
how
 
to
 
fit
 
it
 
like
 
in
 
a
 
story
 
format
 
that
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
get,
 
because
 
people
 
love
 
journeys,
 
they
 
love
 
stories,
 
and
 
if
 
people,
 
and
 
if
 
they
 
see
 
other
 
people
 
that
 
got
 
to
 
the
 
result
 
that
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
get,
 
there's
 
a
 
higher
 
chance
 
that
 
they're
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
believe
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
get
 
to
 
there
 
as
 
well.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
biggest
 
needle
 
movers,
 
like
 
movers,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion.
 
You
 
implement
 
these
 
with
 
me,
 
without
 
me,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
improve
 
your
 
results
 
unbelievably.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
think
 
if
 
there's
 
anything
 
else
 
that
 
I
 
can...
 
30:56
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra

Well,
 
I
 
appreciate
 
your
 
time
 
and
 
your
 
willingness
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
me.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
I
 
haven't
 
looked
 
into,
 
so
 
apparently
 
you
 
specialize
 
in
 
Facebook
 
and
 
getting
 
videos
 
on,
 
is
 
that
 
correct?
 
31:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
more
 
a
 
creative
 
side
 
person.
 
And
 
I
 
love
 
copywriting
 
and
 
psychology,
 
marketing
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I'm
 
less
 
of
 
a
 
Google
 
side
 
person.
 
Honestly,
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
working
 
with
 
Google.
 
I
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
them.
 
I
 
just,
 
I
 
just,
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
them
 
at
 
all.
 
I
 
just
 
don't
 
like
 
their
 
platform,
 
their,
 
their
 
policies,
 
their
 
click
 
fraud.
 
31:29
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
that.
 
I'm
 
not,
 
I'm
 
not
 
fond
 
of
 
any
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
then,
 
and
 
yet
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
somewhat
 
bound
 
because
 
of
 
course,
 
you
 
know,
 
I,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
about
 
doing
 
what
 
works
 
so
 
people
 
can
 
actually
 
find
 
you.
 
And
 
it's
 
interesting
 
because
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
gone
 
off
 
of
 
Facebook
 
and
 
it's
 
like,
 
well,
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
Facebook
 
anymore.
 
And
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
my
 
last
 
post.
 
And
 
it's
 
really
 
interesting
 
because
 
about
 
three
 
months
 
later,
 
they
 
come
 
back
 
on
 
and
 
they
 
go,
 
okay,
 
well,
 
we've
 
changed
 
our
 
minds.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
to
 
myself.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
know
 
why
 
you
 
changed
 
your
 
mind.
 
It's
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
nobody
 
could
 
find
 
you,
 
you
 
know,
 
which
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
went
 
through
 
eight
 
years
 
ago.
 
It
 
was
 
having
 
people
 
find
 
us.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
sad
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
medical
 
community
 
holds
 
people
 
hostage,
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
I'm
 
concerned.
 
And
 
I
 
came
 
out
 
of
 
Western
 
medicine.
 
So
 
I
 
know
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
what
 
I
 
speak
 
about
 
here.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
they
 
hold
 
them
 
hostage.
 
And,
 
of
 
course,
 
it's
 
difficult
 
to
 
break
 
out
 
of
 
that
 
into,
 
you
 
know,
 
allopathic
 
natural
 
medicine.
 
People
 
couldn't
 
find,
 
you
 
know,
 
places
 
to
 
go
 
until,
 
you
 
know,
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Google
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
other
 
platforms
 
became
 
available.
 
It
 
really
 
was
 
difficult.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
get
 
it.
 
33:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
I'm
 
glad
 
that
 
organics
 
is
 
working
 
for
 
you.
 
Just
 
dial
 
on
 
what
 
I
 
told
 
you.
 
If
 
Facebook
 
is
 
not
 
your
 
piece
 
of
 
cake,
 
that's
 
completely
 
fine.
 
33:08
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
I
 
think
 
I'd
 
like
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
my
 
piece
 
of
 
cake.
 
My
 
last
 
video
 
that
 
I
 
did
 
got
 
735
 
views.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
that's
 
too
 
awful
 
bad.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
rock
 
star
 
next
 
week.
 
But
 
730
 
wasn't
 
too
 
bad.
 
But,
 
but
 
my
 
problem
 
is,
 
you
 
know,
 
again,
 
I
 
realize
 
it
 
takes
 
a
 
while
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
know
 
you.
 
And
 
as
 
like
 
you
 
said,
 
and
 
it's
 
usually
 
that
 
question
 
of
 
authenticity.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
just,
 
I
 
just
 
shoot
 
from
 
the
 
hip.
 
I
 
just
 
tell
 
it
 
like
 
it
 
is.
 
I
 
don't
 
sugarcoat
 
it.
 
So
 
that's,
 
that's
 
what
 
works.
 
If,
 
well,
 
some
 
people
 
don't
 
like
 
that
 
very
 
well.

And
 
when
 
it

I'm

the

right
 
now
 
just
 
to
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
right
 
for
 
you.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
is
 
very
 
simple.
 
The
 
first
 
month
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
charge
 
a

We
 
only
 
charge
 
for
 
creating
 
the

That's
 
$4.97.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
having
 
all
 
the
 
process,
 
connecting,
 
having
 
all
 
the

all

I

that's

seconds.
 
497,
 
from
 
reading
 
all
 
the
 
marketing
 
books
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
on
 
my

there's
 
this

has
 
been
 
made
 
that
 
the
 
number
 
97,
 
for
 
some
 
reason,
 
sounds
 
more
 
appealing
 
than
 
499
 
or
 
495.

Only
 
reason.
 
So,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
your
 
opinion
 
about
 
something.
 
So,
 
we
 
were
 
1295
 
before
 
we
 
were
 
1555,
 
and
 
kind
 
of
 
like
 
you,
 
I
 
like
 
the
 
numbers
 
and
 
the
 
psychology
 
of
 
things.
 
And
 
I
 
had
 
somebody
 
else
 
tell
 
me,
 
a
 
marketing
 
person
 
tell
 
me
 
that,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
they
 
thought
 
1555
 
was
 
too
 
low,
 
and
 
that
 
people
 
get
 
weird
 
if
 
the
 
price
 
is
 
too
 
low
 
for
 
something,
 
because
 
then
 
they
 
think
 
that
 
there's
 
no
 
value.
 
So
 
she
 
said,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
encourage
 
you,
 
come
 
the
 
first
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
to
 
increase
 
your
 
price.
 
I
 
realize
 
you're
 
I'm
 
not
 
filling
 
the
 
beds
 
and
 
doing
 
what
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do,
 
but
 
please,
 
please
 
consider
 
increasing
 
your
 
price,
 
and
 
I
 
went,
 
okay,
 
I'll
 
consider
 
that,
 
and
 
my
 
question
 
to
 
you
 
is,
 
is
 
there
 
a
 
number
 
that
 
stands
 
out
 
to
 
you
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
better
 
than
 
$1,555?
 
36:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It
 
would
 
be
 
either
 
$19.95?
 
36:28
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
$19.97.
 
36:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
$19.97.
 
For
 
some
 
reason,
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
$19.97
 
because
 
it's
 
$9.97.
 
There's
 
a
 
lot
 
of,
 
because
 
in
 
my,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
where
 
it
 
comes
 
from,
 
because
 
when
 
I
 
started
 
studying
 
marketing,
 
there's
 
been
 
all
 
these
 
gurus
 
that
 
sell
 
$9.97
 
courses.
 
36:43
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
That's
 
a
 
whole
 
thing.
 
36:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
thing
 
with
 
$9.97
 
specifically.
 
So
 
$19.95,
 
it's
 
obviously
 
unbiased
 
and
 
it's
 
subjective.
 
That's
 
okay.
 
36:54
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
I'm
 
just,
 
I
 
love
 
your
 
authenticity.
 
36:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I
 
just,
 
from
 
the
 
gut,
 
this
 
is
 
where
 
I'm
 
going.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
Thank
 
you
 
so
 
much.
 
I'll
 
we're
 
fortunate.
 
So,
 
$19.95
 
or
 
$24.95,
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
go
 
with.
 
37:09
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Can
 
I
 
run
 
a
 
number
 
by
 
you?
 
See,
 
because
 
I
 
was
 
thinking,
 
I
 
mean,
 
too
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
jump
 
makes
 
me
 
a
 
little
 
nervous.
 
Not
 
that
 
I'm
 
not
 
willing
 
to
 
do
 
it,
 
but
 
it
 
makes
 
me
 
a
 
little
 
nervous.
 
But
 
I
 
wondered
 
about
 
$18.80.
 
37:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
$18.80.
 
I
 
actually
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
I've
 
never
 
seen
 
this
 
number
 
before,
 
so
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
opinion
 
about
 
it.
 
37:35
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
All
 
right.
 
All
 
right.
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
thinking
 
about
 
$19.95.
 
37:42
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
really
 
don't.
 
Yeah,
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
split
 
it
 
to
 
four
 
payments,
 
it
 
comes
 
down
 
to
 
being
 
$4.90
 
something.
 
37:56
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
calculator.
 
37:58
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'll
 
figure
 
it
 
out.
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
$4.99.
 
I'm
 
38:01
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
I'm
 
sure
 
it's
 
$4.99.
 
38:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
38:03
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
Yeah.
 
38:05
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
everything.
 
Oh,
 
and
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
it's
 
$497
 
for
 
creating
 
the
 
ads
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
month.
 
We
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
set
 
a
 
specific
 
KPI
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
hit
 
from
 
the
 
ads,
 
okay?
 
Whether
 
that's
 
consultations,
 
calls
 
booked,
 
and
 
everything.
 
If
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
hit
 
that
 
KPI,
 
you're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
us
 
the
 
retainer
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
month.
 
The
 
retainer
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
month
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
two
 
options.
 
One,
 
it's
 
either
 
a
 
flat
 
retainer
 
of
 
$1,200,
 
or
 
it's
 
a
 
reduced
 
retainer
 
of
 
$9.95.
 
And
 
we
 
take...
 
38:38
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah,
 
of
 
course
 
it
 
is.
 
38:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
we
 
take...
 
38:41
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
only
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
you
 
$9.97
 
though,
 
so
 
forget
 
it.
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
not
 
paying
 
you
 
$9.95,
 
but
 
go
 
ahead.
 
38:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
God.
 
So,
 
the
 
second
 
option
 
is
 
your
 
$9.97
 
plus
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
sales.
 
So,
 
what
 
you
 
make
 
from,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
sales,
 
and
 
then
 
we...
 
We
 
got...
 
Reward
 
it
 
for
 
for
 
the
 
more
 
money
 
that
 
you
 
make.
 
So
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
two
 
options.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
that's,
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
It's
 
extremely
 
simple.
 
39:09
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
So
 
yeah,
 
and
 
yeah,
 
I,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
interested
 
in
 
that.
 
I,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
one
 
more
 
person
 
that
 
wants
 
$10,000
 
up
 
front,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
chew
 
my
 
own
 
wrist
 
off.
 
39:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
I'm
 
always
 
wondering
 
how,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
enough
 
confidence
 
to
 
ask
 
for
 
that
 
amount
 
of
 
money
 
now,
 
because
 
I
 
am
 
building
 
my
 
reputation.
 
Like
 
I
 
have,
 
I
 
have
 
done
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
things
 
in
 
the
 
Israeli
 
market,
 
but
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
market
 
yet.
 
And
 
it's
 
a
 
completely.
 
39:40
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Here's
 
my,
 
here's
 
my
 
moral
 
dilemma.
 
And,
 
and
 
I
 
realize
 
in
 
sales,
 
there's
 
not
 
supposed
 
to
 
ever
 
be
 
a
 
moral
 
dilemma.
 
We
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
have
 
given
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
free
 
services
 
to
 
people,
 
to
 
veterans,
 
and
 
to
 
women
 
with
 
PTSD
 
for
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
reasons,
 
whether
 
it's
 
trauma
 
or
 
childhood
 
trauma.
 
and,
 
and,
 
and,
 
So
 
women
 
with
 
children
 
that
 
have
 
no
 
money,
 
let's
 
just
 
be
 
a
 
role
 
player.
 
40:05
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
They
 
don't
 
have
 
any
 
money.
 
40:06
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
So
 
we've
 
given
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
or
 
reduced
 
cost
 
because
 
I'm
 
a
 
nonprofit
 
501c3.
 
So
 
I
 
say,
 
okay,
 
well,
 
it's
 
$10,000
 
over
 
here.
 
And
 
yes,
 
I
 
can
 
garner
 
more
 
business,
 
but
 
then
 
I
 
can't
 
give
 
away.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can't
 
have
 
a
 
scholarship
 
program
 
because
 
I've
 
spent
 
all
 
my
 
money
 
on
 
marketing
 
over
 
here.
 
So
 
there
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
balance
 
for
 
me
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
sleep
 
with
 
at
 
night.
 
And
 
when
 
you
 
want
 
$10,000
 
for
 
something
 
up
 
front
 
and
 
zero
 
guarantee
 
that
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
even
 
get
 
the
 
people
 
to
 
me,
 
I
 
got
 
a
 
real
 
problem
 
with
 
that.
 
So,
 
because
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
don't,
 
I
 
can't
 
guarantee
 
you
 
something
 
on
 
psilocybin,
 
but
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
real
 
close
 
to
 
telling
 
you
 
that
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
life
 
changing,
 
life
 
altering
 
experience.
 
And
 
I've
 
only
 
had
 
four
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
last.
 
It's
 
eight
 
years,
 
walk
 
away
 
from
 
having
 
what
 
I
 
call
 
a
 
nothing
 
experience.
 
Two
 
of
 
those
 
people
 
lied
 
to
 
me,
 
and
 
they
 
were
 
actually
 
taking
 
an
 
SSRI.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
take
 
an
 
SSRI,
 
you
 
don't
 
get
 
any
 
lift.
 
You
 
don't
 
get
 
anything.
 
You
 
get
 
nothing
 
because
 
that
 
SSRI
 
basically
 
kills
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
the
 
psilocybin.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
harm
 
you.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
harm
 
you,
 
but
 
you've
 
now
 
come
 
to
 
me
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
basically,
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
lied
 
to
 
me
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
what
 
it
 
is
 
that
 
you're
 
taking.
 
Because
 
I
 
have
 
had
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
said,
 
you
 
know,
 
who
 
have
 
paid
 
right
 
away
 
and
 
then
 
said,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
down
 
off
 
of
 
this
 
SSRI.
 
I've
 
had
 
some
 
issues
 
doing
 
that,
 
and
 
I
 
just
 
reschedule
 
them
 
for
 
another
 
retreat.
 
I
 
don't
 
take
 
their
 
money
 
and
 
run.
 
I
 
don't
 
say,
 
well,
 
you've
 
paid
 
for
 
this
 
retreat.
 
And
 
so,
 
you
 
know,
 
now
 
you're
 
out
 
the
 
money.
 
I
 
don't,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
don't,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
don't.
 
Screw
 
people
 
out
 
of
 
their
 
money.
 
That's
 
the
 
bottom
 
line.
 
And
 
I
 
give
 
you
 
and
 
during
 
COVID,
 
when
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
nonsense
 
was
 
happening,
 
and
 
I
 
scheduled
 
people
 
two
 
years
 
out.
 
So
 
I
 
had
 
people
 
that
 
couldn't
 
come
 
right
 
away.
 
We
 
held
 
their
 
money,
 
held
 
their
 
name,
 
worked
 
them
 
in.
 
I
 
mean,
 
that's
 
the
 
way
 
I
 
do
 
business.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
just
 
I'm
 
not
 
into
 
people
 
here.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
just
 
I'm
 
just
 
not.
 
And
 
I
 
so
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
just
 
just
 
integrity.
 
You
 
know,
 
I
 
just
 
I,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
that's
 
the
 
only
 
reason
 
why
 
the
 
$10,000
 
a
 
month
 
and
 
the
 
whatever,
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going,
 
yeah,
 
there's
 
just
 
no
 
integrity
 
with
 
that.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can't
 
get
 
on
 
board
 
with
 
that.
 
can't
 
help
 
other
 
people
 
with
 
that.
 
And
 
again,
 
we're
 
not
 
one
 
of
 
those
 
companies
 
that's,
 
that's,
 
you
 
know,
 
charging,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
god
 
awful
 
amount
 
to
 
do
 
this.
 
If
 
I
 
could
 
do
 
that,
 
then
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
care
 
about
 
I
 
about
 
Google
 
because
 
I
 
Just
 
drop
 
100K
 
into
 
a
 
Google
 
account,
 
and
 
I'd
 
ran
 
all
 
the
 
ads
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
because,
 
like
 
you
 
said,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
Google
 
turns
 
a
 
blind
 
eye
 
to
 
that.
 
And
 
my
 
SEO
 
guy
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
in
 
the
 
UK
 
has
 
told
 
me
 
that
 
for
 
10
 
years.
 
He
 
said,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
you're
 
dropping
 
$100,000,
 
and
 
he
 
goes,
 
and
 
I
 
got
 
two
 
or
 
three
 
clients
 
that
 
do
 
that,
 
that
 
are
 
dropping
 
$100,000
 
a
 
month
 
into
 
Google,
 
and
 
they
 
can
 
advertise
 
whatever
 
they
 
want.
 
And
 
he
 
goes,
 
and
 
we've
 
done
 
it
 
again
 
and
 
again.
 
So
 
he
 
goes,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
Google
 
turns
 
a
 
blind
 
eye.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
I'm
 
with
 
you.
 
Send
 
me
 
your
 
information.
 
I'm
 
interested.
 
I
 
probably
 
can't
 
do
 
anything
 
until
 
January,
 
but
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
follow
 
your
 
instructions
 
here
 
because
 
I
 
took
 
notes.
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
a,
 
what
 
did
 
you
 
say?
 
It's
 
an,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
an
 
SMS
 
message
 
out
 
to
 
everybody.
 
And
 
we'll
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
and
 
link
 
that
 
to
 
my
 
funnel
 
page.
 
is
 
внимание,
 
but
 
I'll
 
Um,
 
the,
 
the
 
page
 
that
 
I've
 
had
 
for
 
the
 
last
 
eight
 
years
 
was,
 
um,
 
meal
 
foundation
 
backs
 
base,
 
um,
 
or
 
back
 
up
 
slash
 
retreats.
 
We
 
changed
 
the
 
funnel
 
page,
 
hoping
 
that
 
would
 
help.
 
I
 
haven't
 
noticed
 
any
 
difference
 
yet,
 
but
 
it's
 
only
 
been
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
weeks.
 
So
 
we'll
 
see.

Um,
 
and
 
then,
 
yeah.
 
Um,
 
what
 
I
 
like
 
to
 
own,
 
um,
 
Facebook
 
in
 
regards
 
to
 
psilocybin
 
and
 
videos.
 
I
 
think
 
so.
 
Um,
 
think
 
I'd
 
like,
 
I
 
think
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
crush
 
the
 
competition.

Oriel

So,
 
yeah.
 
If
 
there's
 
any
 
competition
 
that
 
is
 
even
 
doing
 
any
 
remote
 
good,
 
good
 
job,
 
because
 
most
 
people
 
do
 
not
 
do
 
good
 
job
 
at
 
all
 
on
 
Facebook.

reminds

about
 
the
 
numbers.
 
45:35

You
 
said
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
thing
 
with
 
numbers.
 
45:36
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
anything
 
with
 
the
 
number
 
17
 
particularly?
 
I
 
do
 
happen
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
thing.
 
17
 
converts
 
to
 
8.
 
8's
 
a
 
power
 
number
 
for
 
abundance.
 
45:48

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
17
 
converts
 
to
 
8?
 
45:49
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Really?
 
1
 
plus
 
7
 
is
 
8.
 
45:53

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Holy
 
.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
listen
 
to
 
this.
 
45:55
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
hear
 
something
 
the
 
same?
 
45:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
in
 
April.
 
I
 
had
 
the
 
number
 
17
 
pop
 
up
 
everywhere
 
for
 
me,
 
out
 
of
 
nowhere,
 
really
 
out
 
of
 
nowhere,
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
am
 
I
 
losing
 
my
 
mind?
 
What
 
is
 
going
 
on
 
here?
 
I
 
don't
 
understand
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
here,
 
and
 
it's
 
gotten
 
to
 
the
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
was
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
with
 
my
 
girlfriend,
 
and
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
cars,
 
the
 
driving
 
license
 
was
 
I7,
 
I7,
 
I7.
 
That
 
was
 
the
 
driving
 
license,
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
what
 
is
 
this?
 
What
 
is
 
going
 
on?
 
And
 
I
 
basically
 
ignored
 
it
 
for
 
a
 
little
 
while.
 
was
 
trying
 
to
 
look
 
for
 
patterns
 
with
 
this
 
number,
 
and
 
I
 
couldn't
 
understand
 
what
 
the
 
meaning
 
of
 
it
 
was,
 
and
 
I
 
still
 
do
 
not,
 
but
 
listen
 
to
 
this.
 
When
 
I
 
came
 
back
 
home,
 
I
 
was
 
in
 
Prague
 
for
 
a
 
month
 
and
 
a
 
half
 
with
 
my
 
girlfriend
 
again,
 
and
 
I
 
came
 
back
 
home,
 
two
 
days
 
after
 
I
 
came
 
home,
 
my
 
dad
 
has
 
passed.
 
His
 
funeral
 
was
 
on
 
the
 
17th
 
of
 
August.
 
What
 
else
 
was
 
on
 
the
 
17th
 
of
 
August.
 
My
 
parents'
 
marriage
 
was
 
on
 
the
 
17th
 
of
 
August.
 
And
 
also,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
there's
 
this
 
Jewish
 
ceremony
 
in
 
which
 
they
 
basically
 
cut
 
your
 
after
 
you
 
get
 
born.
 
47:16
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah.
 
47:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
on
 
the
 
17th.
 
Mine
 
was
 
on
 
the
 
17th.
 
And
 
it
 
was
 
just
 
insane
 
to
 
me.
 
And
 
you
 
know
 
where
 
my
 
dad
 
is
 
buried
 
in
 
the
 
graveyard?
 
He's
 
buried
 
his,
 
he's
 
on
 
the
 
8th,
 
on
 
the
 
8th
 
spot
 
on
 
the
 
graveyard.
 
Like
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
place,
 
like
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
number,
 
it's
 
the
 
8th
 
place.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
this
 
is
 
insane.
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
thinking,
 
I'm
 
just,
 
I
 
don't
 
understand
 
the
 
meaning
 
of
 
it,
 
or
 
if
 
it's
 
connected
 
or
 
what's
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
it
 
anyways.
 
But
 
it's
 
just
 
unbelievable
 
to
 
me,
 
to,
 
because
 
I.
 
48:04
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
So
 
when
 
I
 
tap
 
into
 
that
 
kind
 
of
 
thing
 
happening,
 
whether
 
it's
 
numbers
 
or
 
seeing
 
the
 
same
 
word
 
over
 
and
 
over
 
again
 
or
 
whatever
 
the
 
case
 
may
 
be,
 
so
 
Joe
 
Disponza,
 
if
 
you
 
ever
 
have
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
see
 
any
 
of
 
his
 
videos,
 
talks
 
about,
 
he
 
says
 
to
 
the
 
universe
 
in
 
the
 
morning,
 
show
 
me
 
in
 
a
 
way,
 
show
 
me
 
something
 
so
 
miraculous.
 
In
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
it
 
comes
 
from
 
you.
 
And
 
it's
 
interesting
 
because
 
when
 
I
 
start
 
seeing
 
the
 
same
 
numbers
 
over
 
and
 
over
 
again,
 
or
 
the
 
same
 
words
 
over
 
and
 
over
 
again,
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
call
 
out
 
to.
 
So
 
whether
 
you
 
believe
 
it's
 
an
 
angel
 
number
 
or
 
just
 
a
 
number
 
from
 
the
 
divine,
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
children
 
born
 
on
 
the
 
17th.
 
One
 
of
 
them
 
is
 
the
 
17th
 
of
 
April,
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
was
 
the
 
17th
 
of
 
July.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
told
 
by
 
a
 
Sikh
 
woman
 
40
 
years
 
ago
 
that
 
that
 
was
 
incredibly
 
significant.
 
So
 
it's
 
kind
 
of
 
interesting
 
to
 
me
 
to
 
have
 
this
 
conversation
 
now
 
with
 
you
 
about
 
17,
 
and
 
of
 
course,
 
I
 
always
 
know
 
that
 
17
 
is
 
a
 
power
 
number,
 
because
 
it
 
makes
 
eight.
 
Eight
 
is
 
the
 
number
 
always
 
of
 
abundance.
 
Always.
 
49:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
is
 
unbelievable,
 
actually.
 
49:24
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
So
 
I
 
would,
 
if
 
I
 
were
 
you,
 
I'm
 
not
 
telling
 
you
 
how
 
to
 
run
 
your
 
stuff.
 
What
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
obviously
 
travel.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
some
 
abundance
 
coming
 
to
 
you.
 
And
 
I
 
would
 
just
 
say
 
to
 
the
 
universe,
 
if
 
this
 
is
 
an
 
abundance
 
number
 
for
 
me,
 
show
 
me,
 
show
 
me
 
even
 
more
 
than
 
I
 
have
 
now.
 
Show
 
me
 
what
 
else
 
is
 
possible.
 
Help
 
me
 
step
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
box
 
of
 
whatever
 
belief
 
that
 
I
 
have,
 
and
 
make
 
this
 
happen.
 
50:00

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm
 
hmm.
 
50:02
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
And
 
then
 
come
 
sit
 
in
 
ceremony
 
with
 
me.
 
50:05
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
definitely
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Oh,
 
my
 
God,
 
the
 
U.S.
 
has
 
been
 
giving
 
me
 
a
 
hard
 
time.
 
Last
 
time
 
that
 
I
 
went
 
there,
 
the
 
immigration,
 
they
 
were,
 
oh,
 
they
 
were
 
annoying,
 
kind
 
of
 
traumatized
 
the
 
whole
 
immigration
 
process.
 
50:17
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
And
 
I'm
 
so
 
sorry
 
about
 
that.
 
And
 
you're
 
right.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like
 
that
 
for
 
a
 
while,
 
I'm
 
afraid.
 
I'm
 
outside
 
of
 
Spokane.
 
I'm
 
on
 
the
 
opposite
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
mountain
 
of
 
Seattle.
 
Most
 
people
 
fly
 
into
 
Seattle
 
because
 
it's
 
easier
 
from
 
other
 
countries.
 
But
 
yes,
 
I
 
get
 
it.
 
So
 
and
 
I'm
 
five
 
hours
 
from
 
Seattle.
 
Like
 
I
 
said,
 
I'm
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
mountain.
 
So
 
Seattle
 
is
 
very
 
wet
 
and
 
rainy
 
and
 
on
 
the
 
on
 
the
 
beach.
 
And
 
we're
 
we're
 
in
 
the
 
mountains.
 
I'm
 
literally
 
on
 
43
 
acres
 
in
 
the
 
forest.
 
50:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Wow.
 
Yes,
 
that's
 
that's
 
that's
 
unbelievable.
 
50:57
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
And
 
the
 
pictures
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
on
 
my
 
website,
 
just
 
so
 
you
 
know.
 
None
 
of
 
those
 
have
 
been
 
photoshopped.
 
I
 
don't
 
photoshop
 
my
 
stuff
 
at
 
all.
 
What
 
you
 
see
 
is
 
what
 
you
 
get.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
any
 
time.
 
Whether
 
we
 
work
 
together
 
or
 
not,
 
you're
 
always
 
welcome.

Oriel
 
Mor

Thank
 
you
 
so
 
much.
 
I
 
appreciate
 
that.
 
51:16
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
That
 
shows
 
that
 
I've
 
done
 
something
 
right
 
on
 
this
 
call.
 
51:19

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
appreciate
 
that
 
so
 
much.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
great
 
time
 
talking
 
to
 
you.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
everything.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
help
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
me
 
as
 
well,
 
you're
 
free
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
Just
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
And
 
I
 
really,
 
I
 
really
 
hope
 
that
 
you
 
implement
 
these
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
tell
 
you,
 
it's
 
going
 
to,
 
I
 
believe,
 
I
 
really
 
believe
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
increase
 
your
 
conversion
 
rate
 
and
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
your
 
retreats.

Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
You
 
know,
 
I
 
can't
 
figure
 
out,
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
you
 
know,
 
because
 
it
 
says
 
on
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
that
 
page,
 
you
 
know,
 
on
 
that
 
funnel
 
page,
 
I
 
believe
 
still,
 
because
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
we
 
just
 
changed
 
it
 
two
 
weeks
 
ago,
 
you
 
know,
 
call
 
me,
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
me.
 
But
 
you
 
may
 
be
 
right
 
about
 
the
 
SMS
 
message,
 
messaging
 
people.
 
And
 
also
 
a
 
calendar,
 
a
 
calendar.
 
52:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It
 
would
 
be
 
good,
 
too,
 
to
 
let
 
people
 
book
 
a
 
consultation
 
with
 
you,
 
see
 
if
 
it's
 
fit
 
for
 
them.
 
Yeah.
 
So,
 
like,
 
three
 
main
 
things.
 
Having
 
an
 
SMS.
 
52:09
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
People
 
are
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
call.
 
People
 
just
 
don't
 
call
 
these
 
days.
 
They
 
just
 
don't
 
do
 
that
 
anymore.
 
52:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
52:13
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
Yeah.
 
52:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
pushing
 
them,
 
giving
 
them,
 
like,
 
nudging
 
them
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
consultation,
 
showing
 
them
 
a
 
presentation,
 
explaining
 
exactly
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
success
 
stories,
 
show
 
success
 
stories.
 
Do
 
everything
 
to
 
create
 
the
 
hope
 
and
 
make
 
them
 
understand
 
that
 
there's
 
immense
 
value
 
because
 
you
 
know
 
there's
 
immense
 
value.
 
And
 
when
 
you
 
believe
 
in
 
that,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
way
 
easier
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
actually
 
transfer
 
that
 
to
 
the
 
other
 
side
 
and
 
communicate
 
that
 
the
 
other
 
side.
 
Like,
 
can
 
see
 
on
 
me
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
on
 
you,
 
yes,
 
we
 
are
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
wavelength
 
when
 
we
 
talk.
 
It's
 
pretty
 
easy
 
to
 
see.
 
So,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
That's
 
it,
 
you
 
know?
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
Awesome.
 
52:51
 
-
 
Mark
 
Debra
 
Meehl
 
All
 
So,
 
I'm
 
to
 
send
 
you.
 
I
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
looking
 
at
 
your
 
email
 
and,
 
yeah.
 
And
 
then
 
formulating
 
a
 
plan.
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
To
 
see
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
do.
 
Because
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
mind
 
owning
 
Facebook,
 
so.
 
53:06

Oriel
 
Mor

me

everything,

Hi,
 
so
 
sorry
 
about
 
that.
 
meeting
 
is
 
being
 
recorded.
 
How's
 
it
 
going?
 
0:04
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Good,
 
how
 
are
 
you?
 
0:06
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Great,
 
great.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
dive
 
deep
 
in.
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
how
 
your
 
dog
 
is
 
today.
 
0:12
 
-
 
Hannah
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
extremely...
 
Oh,
 
wait,
 
I
 
cannot
 
hear
 
you.
 
0:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
repeat
 
myself.
 
0:18
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yes,
 
sorry.
 
0:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Great.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
dive
 
right
 
in.
 
I'm
 
very
 
direct.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
see.
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
you
 
about
 
how
 
your
 
dog
 
is
 
today
 
or
 
how
 
your
 
cat
 
is,
 
whatever
 
you
 
like.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
extremely
 
direct
 
to
 
what
 
you've
 
done
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
I
 
took
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
your
 
form.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
actually
 
go
 
over
 
it
 
with
 
you
 
right
 
now
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
help
 
you.
 
And
 
that's
 
the
 
main
 
purpose.
 
And
 
if
 
I
 
can,
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
fit
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
good
 
energies
 
together,
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
work
 
together.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
Java
 
between...
 
You
 
fill
 
out
 
the
 
form
 
twice,
 
I
 
saw.
 
And
 
you
 
change
 
it
 
from
 
60
 
to
 
80
 
to
 
70
 
to
 
100
 
patients.
 
You
 
have
 
TMS,
 
medication
 
management.
 
You're
 
running
 
ads
 
yourself.
 
Biggest
 
marketing
 
challenge
 
is
 
that
 
you're
 
not
 
sure
 
if
 
you're
 
doing
 
it
 
right
 
or
 
dragging
 
any
 
patients.
 
You're
 
So
 
let's
 
tackle
 
that
 
like
 
onwards
 
right
 
now.
 
What
 
makes
 
you
 
feel
 
like
 
that
 
you're
 
not
 
doing
 
it
 
right?
 
Do
 
not
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
stats
 
are?
 
What's
 
your
 
cost
 
for
 
lead,
 
cost
 
for
 
booking,
 
cost
 
for
 
acquiring
 
a
 
patient?
 
1:14
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
honestly
 
just
 
like,
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
only
 
ads
 
that
 
I'm
 
running
 
really
 
are
 
on
 
Facebook
 
ads
 
that
 
I
 
like
 
just
 
recently
 
put
 
up
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
like
 
I
 
just
 
filled
 
out
 
the
 
form
 
that
 
they
 
gave
 
me
 
and
 
I
 
haven't
 
honestly
 
had
 
time
 
to
 
even
 
check
 
if
 
it's
 
like
 
I
 
get
 
likes
 
on
 
the
 
ad
 
every
 
here
 
and
 
there.
 
But
 
like,
 
that
 
doesn't
 
really
 
mean
 
anything.
 
You
 
know,
 
they're
 
not.
 
I
 
don't
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
that
 
we've
 
gotten
 
any
 
patients
 
from
 
it
 
so
 
far.
 
1:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
only
 
been
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
weeks.
 
Okay,
 
what's
 
the
 
budget
 
that
 
you're
 
on
 
on
 
there?
 
1:42
 
-
 
Hannah
 
You
 
have
 
an
 
idea?
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
think
 
on
 
Facebook,
 
it's
 
like
 
$50
 
a
 
month,
 
maybe,
 
or
 
a
 
month,
 
a
 
week,
 
maybe.
 
1:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Uh,
 
no,
 
no,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
work
 
per
 
week
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
It's
 
a
 
per
 
day
 
budget.
 
So
 
when
 
you
 
set
 
up
 
the
 
campaign,
 
do
 
you
 
remember,
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
like
 
$30,
 
30
 
to
 
$50.
 
2:01
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Like
 
I
 
said,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
time.
 
So
 
I
 
set
 
it
 
up,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
was
 
like
 
I
 
set
 
it
 
and
 
forget
 
it,
 
and
 
I
 
randomly
 
get
 
notifications,
 
and
 
I
 
haven't
 
even
 
looked
 
at
 
it.
 
2:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
it's
 
been
 
running
 
for
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
weeks.
 
Where
 
did
 
you
 
get
 
most
 
of
 
your
 
patients
 
up
 
or
 
tail
 
down?
 
Because
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
nice
 
patient
 
count,
 
actually.
 
2:22
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Word
 
of
 
mouth.
 
We
 
have
 
lots
 
of
 
patients
 
out
 
of
 
mouth.
 
2:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
have
 
a
 
great
 
reputation.
 
Great.
 
That's
 
amazing.
 
I
 
love
 
that.
 
That's
 
a
 
huge
 
green
 
flag.
 
2:31
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
testimonials?
 
Yes.
 
I
 
mean,
 
we
 
have
 
over
 
–
 
we
 
have
 
34
 
Google
 
reviews,
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
lots
 
of
 
testimonials.
 
2:38
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
awesome.
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
the
 
problem.
 
Basically,
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
time
 
to
 
track
 
the
 
stats.
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
working.
 
It's
 
a
 
very
 
important
 
thing
 
to
 
know
 
because
 
if
 
you're
 
burning
 
$1,500
 
a
 
month
 
on
 
Facebook,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
bringing
 
money.
 
$1,500
 
a
 
month,
 
it's
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
big
 
amount
 
to
 
spend
 
without
 
knowing
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
Have
 
you
 
had
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
watch?
 
Did
 
any
 
of
 
my
 
videos,
 
the
 
video
 
of
 
me
 
reverse
 
engineering
 
the
 
funnel
 
of
 
that
 
ketamine
 
clinic?
 
3:06
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
did.
 
3:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
did
 
you
 
get
 
any
 
value
 
from
 
that?
 
That's
 
the
 
first
 
thing?
 
3:11
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Did
 
you
 
see?
 
I
 
did.
 
I
 
guess
 
I
 
don't
 
really
 
know
 
how
 
I
 
would
 
put
 
that
 
into
 
play
 
without
 
guidance.
 
3:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
I'll
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
you,
 
the
 
main
 
purpose
 
of
 
these
 
videos
 
is
 
to
 
show
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing,
 
we're
 
knowing
 
what
 
we're
 
doing,
 
and
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
expertise
 
and
 
knowledge.
 
So
 
you
 
come
 
on
 
a
 
call,
 
you
 
trust
 
me
 
more,
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
it's
 
easier
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
sell
 
to
 
you,
 
that's
 
the
 
whole
 
purpose
 
of
 
it,
 
because
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
tools
 
to
 
help
 
you.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
Facebook
 
ads
 
running,
 
is
 
it
 
to
 
a
 
landing
 
page,
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
to
 
a
 
Facebook
 
lead
 
form?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any?
 
3:51
 
-
 
Hannah
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
3:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
quick
 
hack?
 
So
 
let's
 
do
 
something
 
interesting
 
here.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
write
 
your
 
clinic's
 
name.
 
SCREEN
 
SHARING:
 
Oriel
 
started
 
screen
 
sharing
 
-
 
WATCH:
 
https://fathom.video/share/6fFE24Bvxm7-q3gzaixQs7Ba7azFiKTw?timestamp=238.883768
 
And
 
what's
 
called
 
the
 
ads
 
library
 
of
 
Facebook.
 
4:03
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Have
 
you
 
heard
 
of
 
that
 
before?
 
I'm
 
assuming.
 
4:04
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
basically
 
see
 
the
 
ads
 
that
 
you're
 
running
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
see
 
where
 
it
 
leads
 
people
 
to,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
4:11
 
-
 
Hannah
 
By
 
the
 
way,
 
I
 
am
 
from
 
Israel,
 
so
 
I
 
hope
 
that
 
you
 
don't
 
hate
 
us
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
Oh,
 
no,
 
Great.
 
4:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
because
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
signed
 
up
 
and
 
I
 
told
 
him,
 
oh,
 
I'm
 
from
 
Israel.
 
He's
 
like,
 
do
 
you
 
support
 
the
 
genocide
 
that
 
your
 
country
 
is
 
committing?
 
4:25
 
-
 
Hannah
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
okay,
 
thank
 
you
 
so
 
much.
 
We're
 
not
 
continuing
 
this
 
conversation.
 
4:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
He's
 
like,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
care.
 
It's
 
only
 
your
 
government.
 
Can
 
we,
 
I
 
don't
 
care
 
about
 
you.
 
I
 
love
 
Israelis.
 
Can
 
we
 
still
 
have
 
a
 
call?
 
Like
 
starting
 
to
 
beg
 
me
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
them,
 
which
 
was
 
actually
 
kind
 
of
 
crazy
 
how
 
these
 
people
 
work,
 
honestly.
 
Yeah.
 
4:42
 
-
 
Hannah
 
That
 
is
 
a
 
little
 
crazy.

Okay.
 
So
 
let's
 
go
 
here,
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
find
 
the
 
right
 
page.
 
Is
 
that
 
the
 
right
 
one?
 
Yep.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
followers,
 
which
 
is
 
good.
 
That's
 
good
 
credibility.
 
So
 
let's
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
here.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
you
 
have,
 
ah,
 
that's
 
not
 
working.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
That's
 
not
 
working
 
because,
 
uh,
 
there's
 
a,
 
with
 
ads,
 
there
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
specific,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
break
 
this
 
down
 
to
 
you.
 
Um,
 
break
 
free
 
from
 
depression
 
with
 
Neurostar
 
TMS.
 
It's
 
a,
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
to
 
start
 
ads
 
with
 
these
 
kinds
 
of
 
claims.
 
I
 
start
 
with
 
curiosity.
 
It's
 
called
 
the
 
hook.
 
So
 
as
 
you
 
see
 
the
 
video,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
hooks
 
and
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
just
 
to
 
you,
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand,
 
uh,
 
what
 
the
 
hooks
 
are.
 
And
 
I,
 
we
 
usually
 
do
 
videos.
 
Okay.
 
We
 
love
 
videos
 
a
 
lot.
 
Videos
 
is
 
the
 
strongest
 
form
 
of,
 
of
 
advertising
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
today,
 
uh,
 
in
 
this
 
age.
 
So
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
is
 
we,
 
give
 
clients
 
the
 
guidance
 
to
 
film,
 
uh,
 
videos.
 
Okay.
 
Authentic
 
videos
 
with
 
your
 
phone,
 
not
 
a
 
crazy
 
setup.
 
You
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
prop
 
up
 
your
 
phone,
 
have
 
a
 
mic
 
that
 
costs
 
like
 
40
 
bucks
 
and
 
you
 
do
 
what
 
we
 
tell
 
you
 
to
 
do.
 
We
 
edit
 
the
 
videos,
 
we
 
do
 
everything.
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
hooks.
 
So,
 
this
 
hook
 
here
 
is
 
like,
 
for
 
example,
 
there's
 
only
 
one
 
real
 
way
 
to
 
solve.
 
So
 
what
 
did
 
I
 
do
 
here?
 
Proposing.
 
Okay.
 
There's
 
one
 
way
 
to
 
solve
 
depression
 
from
 
the
 
root.
 
It's
 
an
 
indirect
 
call
 
out.
 
So
 
I'm
 
not
 
saying
 
like
 
break
 
free
 
the
 
impression.
 
If
 
you're
 
struggling
 
with
 
depression,
 
XYZ,
 
I'm
 
just
 
approaching
 
them
 
indirectly.
 
That
 
also
 
helps
 
with
 
helps
 
with
 
Facebook's
 
policies.
 
And
 
also
 
it
 
makes
 
the
 
ad
 
seem
 
more
 
authentic.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
after
 
that,
 
we
 
test
 
out
 
the
 
hooks
 
because
 
the
 
hook
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
ad.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
ad
 
itself.
 
And
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
ad
 
itself.
 
We
 
usually
 
have
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
that
 
we
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
most.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
reinvent
 
the
 
wheel.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
recreate
 
things.
 
We
 
have
 
two
 
parameters
 
that
 
make
 
it
 
easy
 
for
 
every
 
clinic
 
to
 
have
 
their
 
unique
 
type
 
of
 
ads,
 
even
 
though
 
the
 
template,
 
the
 
template
 
and
 
the
 
process
 
behind
 
creating
 
the
 
ads
 
is
 
similar.
 
So
 
one
 
is
 
the
 
education.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
education
 
ad
 
explaining,
 
talking
 
about
 
their
 
pain
 
points.
 
This
 
is
 
why
 
you've
 
been
 
going
 
through
 
this.
 
This
 
is
 
why
 
the
 
system
 
is
 
wrong
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
solution.
 
Here's
 
how
 
the
 
solution
 
is
 
different.
 
Thank
 
And
 
here's
 
testimonials
 
and
 
studies
 
to
 
back
 
that
 
up.
 
That's
 
the
 
first
 
type
 
of
 
ad,
 
which
 
is
 
education.
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
type
 
of
 
ad
 
is
 
a
 
testimonial-based
 
ad.
 
So
 
a
 
testimonial-based
 
ad
 
is
 
basically
 
having
 
a
 
story
 
of
 
your
 
patient
 
that
 
has
 
broken
 
free.
 
Is
 
that
 
the
 
right
 
way
 
to
 
say
 
it?
 
7:17

Hannah
 
Broken
 
free?
 
7:18

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
They
 
are
 
healed.
 
Yeah,
 
healed
 
from
 
depression.
 
And
 
we
 
were
 
basically
 
writing
 
the
 
script
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
testimonial.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
testimonial
 
of
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
end.
 
And
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
work
 
the
 
best
 
across
 
all
 
industries
 
because
 
I
 
worked
 
with
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
industries,
 
not
 
just
 
mental
 
health.
 
Because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
it
 
makes
 
people
 
relate.
 
People
 
relate
 
to
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
stories.
 
And
 
if
 
they
 
see
 
a
 
person
 
that's
 
been
 
depressed,
 
they
 
solve
 
this
 
problem.
 
They
 
believe
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
solve
 
the
 
problem.
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
when
 
you
 
talk
 
to
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression,
 
they
 
don't
 
believe
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
break
 
free
 
from
 
that
 
because
 
that's
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
identity.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
shift
 
their
 
belief.
 
And
 
I
 
saw
 
that
 
you
 
came
 
from
 
that
 
ad
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
explained
 
about
 
the
 
belief
 
bridge
 
method.
 
to
 
go
 
I'm
 
Thank
 
Is
 
that
 
correct?
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
I
 
talked
 
about
 
that
 
there.
 
I
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
the
 
process
 
that
 
we
 
have.
 
If
 
you
 
want,
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
show
 
you
 
scripts
 
that
 
I
 
wrote
 
for
 
Greenbrook
 
TMS.
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
them
 
by
 
any
 
chance?
 
No.
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
search
 
them
 
up.
 
They're
 
the
 
largest
 
TMS
 
provider
 
in
 
the
 
country.
 
have
 
120
 
clinics
 
across
 
the
 
country.
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
for
 
them
 
for
 
their
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
8:22
 
-
 
Hannah
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
research
 
about
 
them
 
as
 
well.
 
8:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
yeah,
 
so
 
the
 
reason
 
this
 
doesn't
 
work
 
is
 
because
 
it,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
it
 
calls
 
out
 
the
 
problem
 
very
 
boldly.
 
There's
 
these
 
two
 
stars
 
here
 
that
 
just,
 
they
 
don't
 
match
 
the
 
vibe
 
and
 
the
 
energy
 
that's
 
supposed
 
to
 
go
 
here.
 
The
 
picture
 
here
 
doesn't
 
really
 
catch
 
the
 
eye.
 
doesn't
 
do
 
anything.
 
It's
 
like
 
a
 
blank
 
white
 
screen
 
with
 
this
 
arrow,
 
which
 
is
 
basically
 
blending
 
in
 
with
 
the
 
Facebook
 
feed.
 
And
 
another
 
thing
 
is
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
people
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
call
 
to
 
action,
 
for
 
example,
 
you
 
cannot
 
have
 
text
 
or
 
call
 
and
 
also
 
have
 
a
 
link
 
to
 
the
 
website
 
because
 
that's
 
like
 
two
 
different
 
options
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
take.
 
That
 
can
 
confuse
 
people.
 
That's
 
like
 
basic
 
psychology.
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you.
 
As
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
here,
 
welcome
 
to
 
Onward.
 
It's
 
not
 
very
 
conversion
 
driven.
 
There's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
psychological
 
things
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
happen.
 
Also,
 
there's
 
call
 
to
 
actions
 
here
 
for
 
social
 
media,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
very
 
ideal.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
a
 
page
 
that
 
I
 
created
 
today
 
for
 
a
 
new
 
client,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
on.
 
If
 
you
 
want,
 
I
 
can
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
this.
 
9:28
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
this?
 
9:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Am
 
I
 
overwhelming
 
you
 
with
 
information?
 
Because
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
dive
 
into
 
how
 
we
 
work.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
client
 
in
 
central
 
Georgia.
 
Okay.
 
They're
 
called
 
Ketamine
 
Center
 
of
 
Central
 
Georgia.
 
can
 
search
 
them
 
up,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
I've
 
just
 
recreated
 
their
 
landing
 
page
 
and
 
they
 
are
 
offering
 
ketamine
 
microdosing
 
from
 
home.
 
That's
 
what
 
they
 
do.
 
And
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
here
 
in
 
this
 
landing
 
page
 
that
 
make
 
it
 
basically
 
a
 
psychological
 
conversion
 
monster.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
first
 
things
 
first,
 
just
 
as
 
they
 
land
 
on
 
the
 
page,
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
as
 
feature
 
then
 
with
 
all
 
these
 
news
 
because
 
ketamine
 
has
 
been
 
featured
 
on
 
these,
 
you
 
know,
 
on
 
these
 
newspapers.
 
It's
 
not
 
a
 
lie.
 
So
 
that
 
builds
 
authority
 
right
 
on
 
the
 
spot.
 
Then
 
after
 
that,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
hook.
 
The
 
hook
 
here
 
is
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression
 
actually
 
untreatable.
 
So
 
we
 
basically
 
break
 
their
 
belief
 
from
 
the
 
start
 
talking
 
about
 
how
 
there's
 
a
 
groundbreaking
 
treatment
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
studied
 
on
 
over
 
400
 
clinical
 
studies
 
that
 
is
 
proven
 
otherwise.
 
So
 
if
 
you've
 
struggling,
 
this
 
is
 
for
 
you,
 
have
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of,
 
you
 
know,
 
FDA
 
cleared,
 
70%
 
success,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
call
 
to
 
action
 
here
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
free
 
assessment.
 
They
 
take
 
the
 
assessment
 
here
 
and
 
we
 
just
 
filter
 
out
 
people
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
don't
 
get
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
too
 
far
 
away
 
or
 
that
 
they're
 
not
 
from
 
the
 
town
 
because
 
Facebook
 
can
 
actually
 
give
 
you
 
people
 
that
 
just
 
bypass
 
in
 
the
 
town
 
and
 
don't
 
actually
 
live
 
there.
 
So
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
actually
 
filter
 
out
 
these
 
people.
 
So
 
if
 
they
 
say
 
no,
 
disqualify
 
them,
 
we
 
go
 
back
 
here.
 
Then
 
we
 
go
 
down,
 
we
 
already
 
have
 
this
 
Google
 
review
 
to
 
build
 
trust.
 
And
 
after
 
that,
 
we
 
go
 
and
 
basically
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
problem,
 
okay,
 
the
 
problem
 
that
 
millions
 
of
 
people
 
Talking
 
about
 
what
 
they
 
try
 
to
 
do,
 
why
 
it
 
doesn't
 
work,
 
having
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of,
 
you
 
know,
 
funsies
 
here
 
to
 
make
 
it,
 
you
 
know,
 
easy,
 
easygoing
 
and
 
not
 
too
 
dramatic.
 
We
 
have
 
this
 
call
 
to
 
action
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
bottom,
 
which
 
is
 
glowing
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
if
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
sign
 
the
 
assessment,
 
they
 
can
 
just
 
press
 
it
 
and
 
they
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
call
 
to
 
action.
 
So
 
we're
 
just
 
removing
 
as
 
much
 
friction
 
as
 
possible,
 
making
 
people
 
go
 
through
 
an
 
emotional
 
journey,
 
shifting
 
their
 
beliefs,
 
and
 
then
 
giving
 
them
 
the
 
call
 
to
 
action.
 
Okay,
 
talking
 
about
 
the
 
solution,
 
which
 
is,
 
you
 
know,
 
ketamine
 
microdose
 
in
 
this
 
sense,
 
and
 
having
 
more
 
testimonials,
 
talking
 
about
 
the
 
protocol,
 
how
 
it
 
works,
 
what
 
it
 
does.
 
Again,
 
FDA
 
cleared,
 
just
 
hammering
 
that
 
thing
 
again
 
and
 
again
 
and
 
again
 
to
 
create
 
trust
 
in
 
people.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
basically,
 
that's
 
how
 
we
 
built
 
the
 
pages.
 
Only
 
one
 
call
 
to
 
action.
 
There's
 
no
 
social
 
media
 
things.
 
We
 
do
 
have
 
the
 
phone
 
here,
 
but
 
they
 
cannot
 
directly
 
call
 
it.
 
But
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
11:58
 
-
 
Hannah
 
You
 
know,
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
This
 
is
 
the...
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
ad,
 
or
 
now
 
you're
 
talking
 
about
 
building
 
a
 
website?
 
12:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
that's
 
the
 
landing
 
page.
 
So
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
a
 
website
 
and
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
is
 
that
 
a
 
website
 
is
 
strictly
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
search
 
you
 
up
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
you're
 
all
 
about.
 
A
 
landing
 
page
 
has
 
one
 
simple
 
goal,
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
to
 
convert
 
people
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
specific
 
action.
 
In
 
this
 
sense,
 
we
 
want
 
people
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
free
 
assessment
 
and
 
to
 
evaluate
 
whether
 
they
 
are
 
a
 
good
 
fit
 
to
 
the
 
ketamine
 
microdose.
 
And
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
do
 
that
 
is,
 
okay,
 
so
 
we
 
press
 
on
 
yes
 
here.
 
They
 
need
 
to
 
give
 
the
 
date
 
of
 
birth.
 
If
 
they're
 
below
 
18,
 
they
 
cannot
 
do
 
that.
 
We
 
have
 
this
 
little
 
disclaimer
 
here
 
that
 
it's
 
not
 
covered
 
by
 
insurance
 
and
 
doing
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
let's
 
fill
 
this
 
out
 
real
 
quick.
 
That's
 
my
 
birthday,
 
by
 
the
 
way.
 
Press
 
on
 
next.
 
We're
 
talking
 
about
 
what
 
they're
 
struggling
 
with.
 
They
 
can
 
select
 
all
 
the
 
things
 
in
 
here.
 
So
 
let's
 
select
 
other.
 
Then
 
we
 
say,
 
okay,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
hope
 
to
 
get
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
treatment?
 
So
 
we
 
also
 
do
 
that
 
as
 
well
 
here.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
little
 
final
 
filter
 
in
 
question.
 
That
 
is
 
when,
 
if
 
they
 
select
 
one
 
of
 
these,
 
okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
do
 
this,
 
for
 
example,
 
they
 
are
 
just
 
this.
 
And
 
the
 
best
 
thing
 
about
 
this
 
is,
 
is
 
that
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
answers
 
that
 
they
 
give
 
on
 
the
 
form,
 
we
 
are
 
then
 
sending
 
them
 
a
 
personalized
 
message
 
with
 
the
 
variable
 
that
 
they
 
selected.
 
So
 
if
 
they
 
say,
 
I
 
am
 
struggling
 
with
 
PTSD,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
them
 
a
 
message
 
that
 
is
 
specifically,
 
hey,
 
we
 
saw
 
that
 
you're
 
struggling
 
with
 
PTSD.
 
Is
 
that
 
correct?
 
And
 
we
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
conversation
 
with
 
us,
 
which
 
then
 
makes
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
send
 
them
 
a
 
booking
 
link
 
to
 
book
 
the
 
thing
 
themselves.
 
Because
 
they're
 
like,
 
oh,
 
,
 
they
 
sent
 
me
 
a
 
personalized
 
message.
 
That
 
means
 
it's
 
not
 
just
 
an
 
automation,
 
even
 
though
 
it
 
is
 
an
 
automation,
 
but
 
it
 
feels
 
more
 
personalized
 
to
 
them.
 
So
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
psychological
 
factors
 
that
 
come
 
into
 
place
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
catch
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
spot,
 
you
 
know?
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
know
 
I'm
 
over
 
my
 
leaning
 
with
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
information,
 
but
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
we
 
work,
 
how
 
my
 
brain
 
works,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
have
 
you
 
had
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
talk
 
with
 
any
 
other
 
marketing
 
agency
 
or
 
anything
 
of
 
that
 
sort?
 
13:59

Hannah
 
You're
 
the
 
first!
 
14:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
first.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
I'm
 
already
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
you,
 
and
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
sound
 
like
 
I'm
 
throwing
 
stones
 
at
 
people,
 
don't
 
get
 
close
 
to
 
Beyond
 
Marketing,
 
Patient
 
Plus,
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
and
 
CycleHealth.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
any
 
of
 
them
 
are.
 
These
 
are
 
four
 
premium
 
agencies
 
that
 
are
 
burning
 
people
 
left
 
and
 
right,
 
burning
 
clinicians
 
left
 
and
 
right.
 
Okay.
 
They
 
also
 
charge
 
a
 
ton
 
of
 
money,
 
like
 
$5,000,
 
$6,000
 
a
 
month
 
for
 
their
 
retirement.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
just
 
watch
 
out
 
for
 
them,
 
whether
 
you
 
continue
 
with
 
me
 
or
 
not.
 
14:42
 
-
 
Hannah
 
What
 
were
 
those?
 
14:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Can
 
you
 
say
 
those
 
again?
 
Beyond
 
Marketing,
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
Patient
 
Plus,
 
and
 
CycleHealth.
 
Specifically
 
with
 
CycleHealth,
 
they
 
have
 
this
 
prioritization
 
sequence.
 
I
 
just
 
hopped
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
their
 
head
 
of
 
marketing,
 
which
 
wants
 
to
 
leave
 
there
 
because
 
he
 
just
 
hates
 
that
 
he
 
doesn't
 
like
 
The
 
founders,
 
and
 
he
 
told
 
me
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
priority
 
kind
 
of
 
thing
 
going
 
on.
 
If
 
you're
 
a
 
smaller
 
clinic,
 
they
 
don't
 
give
 
a
 
.
 
If
 
you're
 
a
 
higher
 
clinic
 
that's
 
paying
 
like
 
$15,000
 
a
 
month,
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
put
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
resources
 
into
 
you.
 
So
 
basically,
 
there's
 
like
 
a
 
ladder
 
of
 
value
 
for
 
each
 
client,
 
you
 
know?
 
Okay.
 
So
 
it's
 
not
 
doing
 
it
 
for
 
the
 
right
 
reasons.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
that,
 
to
 
know
 
whether
 
you
 
continue
 
with
 
us
 
or
 
not.
 
That's
 
about
 
that.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
dropped
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
information
 
on
 
you.
 
I
 
know
 
usually
 
sales
 
calls
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
like,
 
oh,
 
so
 
what
 
you're
 
struggling
 
with?
 
What's
 
your
 
dream?
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
in
 
life?
 
I'm
 
not
 
that
 
type
 
of
 
person.
 
I'm
 
just
 
telling
 
you
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
do,
 
how
 
we
 
work.
 
15:45
 
-
 
Hannah
 
So
 
walk
 
me
 
through,
 
like,
 
what
 
this
 
would
 
look
 
like
 
if
 
I
 
chose
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
you.
 
Like,
 
what
 
would
 
it
 
be
 
that,
 
like,
 
what
 
would
 
that
 
look
 
like?
 
15:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What
 
would
 
you
 
do
 
for
 
me?
 
What
 
would
 
the
 
cost
 
be,
 
et
 
cetera,
 
et
 
cetera?
 
Okay,
 
so
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
just
 
walk
 
you
 
step-by-step
 
by
 
how
 
it's
 
going.
 
So
 
once
 
you
 
start
 
working
 
with
 
us,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
onboarding
 
form.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
an
 
onboarding
 
form.
 
It's
 
to
 
take
 
like
 
10
 
minutes
 
to
 
fill
 
out
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
information
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
about
 
your
 
business.
 
After
 
you
 
fill
 
that
 
out,
 
there's
 
seven
 
steps
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do.
 
If
 
you're
 
struggling
 
with
 
the
 
steps,
 
it's
 
all
 
good.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
another
 
call
 
in
 
which
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
everything.
 
We
 
are
 
creating
 
the
 
foundations
 
from
 
a
 
platform
 
called
 
Go
 
High
 
Level.
 
16:26
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Are
 
you
 
familiar
 
with
 
this
 
platform?
 
16:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
So
 
it's
 
basically
 
a
 
CRM.
 
It's
 
the
 
strongest
 
CRM
 
on
 
planet
 
Earth.
 
Honestly,
 
it's
 
unbelievable.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
from
 
there.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
automations.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
pipeline.
 
You
 
can
 
manage
 
the
 
leads
 
from
 
there.
 
We
 
can
 
create
 
the
 
website,
 
like
 
the
 
landing
 
pages
 
from
 
there,
 
even
 
though
 
I'm
 
probably
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
for
 
that.
 
And
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
basically
 
manage
 
everything
 
through
 
there.
 
We're
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
whole
 
training
 
sent
 
to
 
you
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
it.
 
They
 
have
 
an
 
app
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
as
 
well,
 
okay?
 
We
 
are
 
then
 
going
 
to
 
also
 
send
 
you
 
scripts
 
for
 
ads.
 
Okay?
 
Scripts
 
for
 
ads.
 
The
 
most
 
important
 
part,
 
because
 
we
 
mostly
 
love
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
videos.
 
We
 
can
 
also
 
start
 
with
 
static
 
ads
 
as
 
the
 
one
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
here.
 
We
 
usually
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
unless
 
the
 
clinic
 
has
 
very
 
good
 
content.
 
So
 
for
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
pictures
 
with
 
patients
 
or
 
pictures
 
of
 
the
 
team,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
get
 
pictures
 
that
 
are
 
just
 
authentic,
 
things
 
that
 
are
 
authentic
 
and
 
show
 
your
 
clinic's
 
value
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
how
 
you
 
guys
 
operate
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
to
 
be
 
human,
 
okay?
 
But
 
we
 
mostly
 
work
 
with
 
video.
 
Then
 
you
 
film
 
the
 
videos,
 
okay?
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
trouble
 
or
 
anything,
 
you
 
can
 
just
 
tell
 
us.
 
We
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call.
 
We
 
are
 
editing
 
the
 
videos,
 
having
 
captions,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Then
 
we
 
upload
 
the
 
videos.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
go
 
live
 
within
 
seven
 
days
 
after
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
training,
 
all
 
the
 
automation
 
set
 
up,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
monitor
 
the
 
results
 
every
 
two
 
weeks.
 
We
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
results
 
like
 
we're
 
seeing
 
the
 
ads
 
every
 
single
 
day.
 
But
 
every
 
two
 
weeks,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
call
 
and
 
analyze
 
the
 
data.
 
Okay,
 
how
 
many
 
leads
 
did
 
we
 
get?
 
What's
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
lead?
 
What's
 
our
 
cost
 
for
 
booking?
 
How
 
many
 
people
 
didn't
 
show
 
up?
 
Why
 
did
 
they
 
not
 
show
 
up?
 
What
 
can
 
improve?
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
where
 
our
 
bottom...
 
And
 
see
 
where
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
lowest
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
that
 
we
 
can.
 
So
 
the
 
lowest
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
is
 
basically
 
getting
 
the
 
patient
 
in-chair.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
patient
 
in-chair
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
lowest
 
as
 
possible.
 
That's
 
what
 
we
 
optimize
 
for.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
care
 
about
 
leads,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
care
 
about
 
likes,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
care
 
about
 
people
 
that
 
comment,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
care
 
about
 
shares,
 
we
 
don't
 
care
 
about
 
any
 
of
 
that.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
care
 
about
 
is
 
conversions,
 
making
 
sure
 
that
 
people
 
come
 
to
 
your
 
clinic,
 
you
 
treat
 
them,
 
you
 
profit,
 
we
 
profit,
 
we
 
help
 
people,
 
and
 
that's
 
it.
 
Very
 
simple.
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
18:37
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
does.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
all,
 
it's
 
all
 
for
 
ads,
 
obviously,
 
all
 
Facebook
 
ads.
 
18:42
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
All
 
Facebook
 
ads.
 
We,
 
I'm
 
thinking,
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
about
 
incorporating
 
Google
 
as
 
well.
 
I
 
honestly
 
hate
 
Google.
 
With
 
Greenbrook
 
specifically,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
lawsuit
 
with
 
them
 
right
 
now,
 
because
 
a
 
third
 
of
 
their
 
clicks
 
on
 
their
 
ads
 
were
 
fraud,
 
bots.
 
And
 
they're
 
spending
 
hundreds
 
of
 
thousands
 
of
 
19:01
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yeah.
 
19:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
stuff.
 
So
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
fan
 
of
 
Google.
 
We're
 
mostly
 
doing
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Instagram
 
ads.
 
We
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
incorporate
 
TikTok,
 
but
 
they
 
have
 
strong,
 
like,
 
horrible
 
policies.
 
And
 
also
 
YouTube
 
for
 
Google,
 
that's
 
like
 
a
 
different
 
part
 
of
 
Google.
 
But
 
we
 
mainly
 
use
 
Facebook
 
ads
 
because
 
they're
 
the
 
most
 
effective.
 
When
 
you
 
educate
 
people,
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
funnel
 
in
 
place,
 
right
 
automations,
 
and
 
the
 
right
 
follow-up
 
process.
 
It
 
makes
 
it
 
easier,
 
you
 
know,
 
to
 
just
 
get
 
results
 
from
 
there.
 
Okay.
 
19:27
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
cost?
 
19:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
works
 
is
 
very
 
simple.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
first
 
month,
 
we
 
have
 
only
 
a
 
setup
 
fee.
 
There's
 
a
 
retainer
 
and
 
the
 
setup
 
fee.
 
do
 
not
 
charge
 
a
 
retainer
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
month
 
because
 
you're
 
actually
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
first
 
10
 
clients
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
join.
 
I'm
 
to
 
be
 
completely
 
transparent
 
with
 
you.
 
And
 
the
 
setup
 
fee
 
is
 
$9.97.
 
From
 
the
 
second
 
month,
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
two
 
options
 
for
 
a
 
retainer.
 
Option
 
number
 
one
 
is
 
a
 
lower
 
retainer
 
of
 
$500
 
plus
 
$100
 
for
 
every
 
booked
 
cost.
 
If
 
the
 
consultation
 
does
 
not
 
show
 
up,
 
it's
 
half
 
to
 
50,
 
so
 
that's
 
a
 
more
 
performance-based
 
model.
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
model
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
flat
 
retainer
 
of
 
$1,500
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
stability.
 
Because
 
if
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
you
 
30
 
consultations
 
a
 
month,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
us
 
$3,500.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
stability,
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
retainer.
 
And
 
also,
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
second
 
month,
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
happy
 
with
 
the
 
results,
 
we
 
are
 
either
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
for
 
free
 
or
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
your
 
money
 
back.
 
Okay?
 
There
 
are
 
no
 
contracts.
 
You
 
can
 
leave
 
whenever
 
you
 
want.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
lock
 
people
 
in
 
chains.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
believe
 
in
 
that.
 
If
 
you
 
love
 
working
 
with
 
us,
 
then
 
you
 
love
 
working
 
with
 
us
 
because
 
we
 
provide
 
you
 
with
 
value.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
relationship
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
very,
 
very
 
simple.
 
20:46
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Okay.
 
20:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
All
 
right.
 
20:48
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Well?
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
I
 
have
 
any
 
other
 
questions.
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
some
 
thinking
 
and
 
some
 
research.
 
20:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
is
 
there
 
anything
 
specific?
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
hesitations,
 
you're
 
to
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
me,
 
right?
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
me
 
about
 
this.
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
hesitation,
 
anything
 
that
 
does
 
not
 
align,
 
anything
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
uncertainty
 
about?
 
21:12
 
-
 
Hannah
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
so,
 
I
 
guess.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
would
 
just
 
really
 
have
 
to
 
figure
 
out
 
if
 
it's
 
worth
 
it,
 
but
 
I
 
guess
 
there's
 
not
 
really
 
any
 
way
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
until
 
seeing
 
if
 
it's
 
worth
 
it
 
by
 
setting
 
it
 
up
 
and
 
seeing
 
if
 
it
 
gets
 
patients
 
into
 
my
 
clinic.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
incorporating
 
the
 
costs
 
and
 
moving
 
forward
 
to
 
that,
 
because
 
as
 
you
 
saw,
 
we
 
do
 
have
 
a
 
pretty
 
good
 
patient
 
flow
 
right
 
now.
 
I
 
would
 
just
 
like
 
to
 
get
 
more
 
patients
 
in
 
for
 
TMS
 
specifically,
 
so
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
put
 
it
 
into
 
my
 
budget,
 
see
 
if
 
it's
 
something
 
that
 
is
 
doable,
 
and
 
just
 
think
 
about
 
moving
 
forward.
 
21:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
either
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
second
 
call,
 
or
 
we
 
can
 
literally
 
run
 
a
 
Simulation
 
right
 
now
 
of
 
what
 
you're
 
expected
 
to
 
get
 
with
 
the
 
budget.
 
22:04
 
-
 
Hannah
 
And
 
if
 
we
 
hit
 
KPIs,
 
how
 
many
 
patients
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
get,
 
then
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
profitable
 
to
 
you,
 
your
 
choice.
 
How
 
are
 
you
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
that?
 
22:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Basically,
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
simulation
 
or
 
just,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
Google
 
doc,
 
see,
 
okay,
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
much
 
we
 
spend.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
benchmarks
 
from
 
what
 
we
 
have
 
for
 
our
 
clinics.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
understand
 
like,
 
what's
 
the
 
ideal
 
situation?
 
What's
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
needing
 
to
 
be
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
price
 
that
 
you
 
sell
 
to
 
people
 
and
 
based
 
on
 
what
 
you
 
get
 
on
 
reimbursed
 
for
 
insurance
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
then
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
it's
 
worth
 
it
 
or
 
not
 
to
 
see.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
see,
 
okay,
 
how
 
many
 
patients
 
do
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
from
 
working
 
with
 
you
 
in
 
order
 
for
 
this
 
to
 
be
 
profitable
 
for
 
me?
 
Okay.
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
Google
 
doc
 
real
 
quick?
 
22:43
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Sure.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it's
 
all
 
hypothetical,
 
obviously.
 
22:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
It
 
is.
 
It
 
is.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
with
 
the
 
most
 
easy
 
stat.
 
What
 
is
 
your
 
profit
 
per
 
patient
 
if
 
they
 
do
 
sign
 
up?
 
Profit.
 
Not
 
like
 
cost
 
that
 
they
 
get
 
you
 
because
 
we
 
care
 
about
 
profit
 
here.
 
23:00
 
-
 
Hannah
 
I
 
mean,
 
it
 
depends
 
on
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
patient
 
of
 
mine,
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
patient
 
of
 
one
 
of
 
my
 
other
 
nurse
 
practitioners.
 
23:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
what's
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
them?
 
23:13
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Like,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
an
 
average?
 
The
 
business
 
gets
 
35%
 
of
 
what
 
the
 
nurse
 
practitioners
 
make
 
in
 
my
 
clinic.
 
But
 
for
 
TMS,
 
it's
 
100
 
because
 
I'm
 
the
 
only
 
one
 
that
 
does
 
TMS.
 
23:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
assume
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
TMS
 
only?
 
No,
 
because
 
of
 
your
 
problem?
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
what's
 
your
 
profit
 
per
 
patient
 
with
 
TMS,
 
if
 
they
 
start
 
a
 
process?
 
23:38
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Average
 
daily
 
treatment
 
is
 
paid
 
about
 
$200
 
by
 
insurance.
 
23:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
And
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
what's
 
the
 
average
 
lifetime
 
value?
 
Like,
 
how
 
much
 
a
 
patient
 
is
 
worth
 
to
 
you
 
and
 
the
 
whole
 
span
 
of
 
your
 
treatment?
 
23:51
 
-
 
Hannah
 
A
 
TMS
 
span
 
of
 
treatment
 
is
 
35
 
treatments
 
plus
 
a
 
third.
 
35
 
treatments
 
of
 
$200
 
and
 
then
 
a
 
$400
 
initial
 
treatment.
 
24:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
30...
 
So
 
that's
 
your
 
profit,
 
right?
 
24:08
 
-
 
Hannah
 
That's
 
not
 
your
 
revenue.
 
24:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Correct.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
the
 
profit
 
is
 
700
 
bucks
 
per
 
patient.
 
So
 
if
 
we
 
run
 
ads,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
the
 
benchmark
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
for
 
a
 
good
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
20
 
bucks.
 
And
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
open
 
up
 
your
 
ads
 
manager
 
and
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
there.
 
You
 
probably
 
don't
 
even
 
track
 
data
 
because
 
I
 
saw
 
the
 
website
 
and
 
there's
 
no
 
conversion
 
tracking
 
there
 
from
 
what
 
I've
 
seen.
 
So
 
you
 
don't
 
even,
 
you
 
cannot
 
even
 
know
 
that,
 
but
 
let's
 
say
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
that's
 
the,
 
like
 
the
 
maximum
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
usually
 
aim
 
towards.
 
That's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
highest
 
approximately
 
25
 
bucks.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
lead
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
25
 
bucks.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
if
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
25
 
bucks,
 
we
 
don't
 
care
 
about
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
obviously.
 
Now
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
consultations.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
people
 
that
 
showed
 
up
 
and
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
people
 
that
 
actually,
 
you
 
know,
 
made
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
clinic.
 
be
 
25
 
bucks.
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
give
 
you
 
kind
 
of
 
worst
 
case
 
scenarios
 
here.
 
Let's
 
say
 
that
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
sign
 
up
 
book,
 
okay?
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
50
 
bucks,
 
okay?
 
And
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
booked
 
are
 
actually
 
going
 
to
 
show
 
up,
 
okay?
 
So
 
that's
 
gonna
 
be
 
cost
 
per
 
show,
 
show
 
of
 
100
 
bucks,
 
okay?
 
Now
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
from
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
showed
 
up,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any,
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
your
 
sales
 
conversion
 
is?
 
Because
 
that
 
differs
 
for
 
every
 
single
 
clinic.
 
You
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
what's
 
your,
 
okay.
 
So
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
a
 
third
 
from
 
each
 
person
 
a
 
business
 
person,
 
I'm
 
a
 
physician.
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
okay,
 
I
 
got
 
that,
 
I
 
got
 
that.
 
So
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
a
 
third
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
come
 
to
 
the
 
clinic
 
actually
 
convert,
 
okay?
 
So
 
that's
 
one
 
out
 
of
 
three
 
people.
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
is
 
three.
 
And
 
what
 
that
 
means,
 
basically,
 
is
 
that
 
for
 
every
 
client
 
that
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
close,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
like
 
worst
 
case
 
scenario
 
metrics,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
300
 
bucks
 
to
 
acquire
 
a
 
patient.
 
The
 
only
 
other
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
incorporate
 
here
 
that
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
boost
 
this
 
up
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
is
 
the
 
retainer
 
that
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
us,
 
which
 
depends
 
on
 
exactly
 
which
 
performance
 
model
 
you
 
take.
 
So
 
if
 
we
 
take,
 
for
 
example,
 
the
 
1500
 
bucks
 
a
 
month,
 
let's
 
say
 
I
 
want
 
to,
 
let's
 
take
 
a,
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
we
 
spend
 
$1,500
 
a
 
month
 
on
 
ad.
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
25
 
bucks,
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
we
 
are,
 
that's
 
75
 
leads,
 
is
 
that
 
correct?
 
Right?
 
Or
 
my,
 
my
 
math
 
is
 
wrong.
 
Let's
 
do
 
this.
 
25,
 
60
 
bucks
 
per
 
lead.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
that's
 
60,
 
60
 
patients,
 
60
 
leads.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
60
 
leads
 
from
 
these
 
60
 
leads,
 
have
 
30
 
bookings
 
from
 
these.
 
of
 
there
 
Thank
 
30
 
bookings,
 
have
 
15
 
shows
 
and
 
five
 
closes,
 
five
 
closes,
 
okay?
 
So
 
you're
 
gonna
 
pay
 
$1,500
 
a
 
month
 
for
 
that
 
and
 
another
 
$1,500
 
for
 
us.
 
So
 
what
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
here
 
is
 
basically
 
just
 
double
 
the
 
metrics.
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$600
 
because
 
we
 
just,
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
$1,500
 
for
 
the
 
ad
 
budget
 
and
 
another
 
$1,500
 
that
 
you
 
pay
 
us.
 
27:27
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
27:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
So
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$600.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
even
 
worsen
 
these
 
metrics,
 
okay?
 
But
 
this
 
is
 
like
 
worst
 
case
 
scenario
 
metrics.
 
But
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
project
 
to
 
happen,
 
okay?
 
And
 
yeah,
 
you
 
tell
 
me
 
if
 
it's
 
worth
 
it
 
or
 
not
 
to
 
even
 
test
 
it
 
out.
 
Because
 
you
 
know,
 
$600
 
and
 
you
 
get
 
$7,500
 
back,
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
worth
 
it,
 
let's
 
be
 
honest.
 
So
 
it's
 
very
 
simple,
 
very,
 
very
 
simple.
 
And
 
also
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
happy
 
with
 
the
 
results,
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
money
 
back
 
guarantee,
 
you
 
know,
 
so.
 
28:01
 
-
 
Hannah
 
But
 
that's
 
if
 
the
 
patients
 
do
 
come.
 
mean,
 
60
 
leads
 
is
 
a
 
lot.
 
28:05
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
No,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
much.
 
It's
 
not
 
that
 
much,
 
60
 
leads.
 
Not
 
at
 
all.
 
What's
 
the
 
population
 
in
 
your
 
area?
 
28:17
 
-
 
Hannah
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
In
 
Norwood,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
28:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
60
 
leads
 
is
 
not
 
that
 
much,
 
honestly.
 
We
 
are
 
aiming
 
for
 
a
 
cost
 
of
 
per
 
lead
 
of
 
$10.
 
Just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand.
 
That's
 
our
 
ideal.
 
And
 
if
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
booking
 
process
 
set
 
in
 
place,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
automations,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
calling
 
the
 
patients,
 
you
 
know,
 
reminders,
 
booking
 
them
 
only
 
three
 
days
 
ahead,
 
having
 
the
 
whole
 
process
 
dialed
 
in
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
these
 
metrics
 
are
 
high,
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
lower.
 
Of
 
course,
 
everything's
 
an
 
if.
 
28:50
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Everything's
 
an
 
if.
 
28:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Right.
 
But
 
this
 
is
 
exactly
 
what
 
we
 
project
 
to
 
happen.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
worse,
 
could
 
be
 
better.
 
But
 
the
 
question
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
ask
 
here
 
is
 
It's
 
like,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
let's
 
take
 
it
 
into
 
an
 
even
 
worse
 
case
 
scenario
 
here,
 
like
 
the
 
worst
 
case
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
ever
 
imagine.
 
You
 
tell
 
me,
 
what's
 
the
 
maximum
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
that
 
you're
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
profitable
 
to
 
you,
 
to
 
your
 
clinic?
 
Like
 
when
 
are
 
you
 
saying,
 
okay,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
this
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
maximum
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
pay,
 
anything
 
beyond
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
worth
 
the
 
profit
 
that
 
I'm
 
making.
 
29:21
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
That's
 
something
 
that
 
I
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
figure
 
out
 
on
 
my
 
own,
 
right?
 
29:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
can't
 
really
 
think
 
of
 
that
 
right
 
now
 
on
 
the
 
spot.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
So
 
we
 
can,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
simulate
 
that,
 
we
 
can
 
put
 
it
 
at
 
$2,500,
 
$3,000,
 
like
 
that's
 
the
 
maximum
 
that
 
you're
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
even
 
reach
 
that,
 
that
 
means
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
10
 
leads
 
a
 
month
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
That's
 
a
 
10
 
leads,
 
if
 
you're
 
getting
 
10
 
leads
 
a
 
month,
 
there's
 
something
 
very
 
wrong
 
with
 
either
 
your
 
marketing
 
or
 
your
 
area
 
is
 
just,
 
and
 
market
 
is,
 
is
 
not,
 
is
 
not
 
there.
 
And
 
there's
 
never
 
a
 
problem
 
with
 
the
 
market.
 
Never.
 
The.
 
The
 
treatments
 
for
 
depression
 
are
 
booming.
 
People
 
need
 
you.
 
People
 
need
 
TMS.
 
You
 
have
 
the
 
tools
 
to
 
help
 
people.
 
The
 
market's
 
there.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
dialed
 
in
 
is
 
the
 
bridge
 
between
 
the
 
product
 
and
 
the
 
marketing
 
itself.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
bridge
 
these
 
two
 
together.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
super
 
simple.
 
Super,
 
super
 
simple.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
30:23
 
-
 
Hannah
 
So
 
what
 
are,
 
like,
 
if
 
I
 
did
 
want
 
to
 
move
 
forward,
 
what
 
are
 
next
 
steps?
 
30:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes.
 
So,
 
tomorrow
 
is
 
Yom
 
Kippur
 
in
 
Israel,
 
which
 
means
 
we
 
are
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
for
 
Wednesday
 
and
 
also
 
Thursday.
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
not
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
pay
 
the
 
full
 
setup
 
fee
 
up
 
front.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
put
 
an
 
I'm
 
serious
 
fee
 
of
 
$100.
 
After
 
that,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
a
 
contract.
 
You
 
can
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
contract,
 
tell
 
me,
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
this.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
change
 
this.
 
I
 
don't
 
understand
 
this.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
another
 
call,
 
okay,
 
to
 
understand,
 
okay,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
change?
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
things.
 
After
 
that,
 
tell
 
me,
 
okay,
 
Oriel,
 
I'm
 
good
 
with
 
that.
 
Or
 
either
 
Oriel,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
this.
 
If
 
you
 
don't
 
want
 
this,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
$100
 
back.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
want
 
it,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
setup
 
fee,
 
and
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
creating
 
the
 
ads.
 
Our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
go
 
live
 
within
 
seven
 
days
 
of
 
us
 
launching.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
as
 
simple
 
as
 
that.
 
Nothing
 
complicated.
 
31:17
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Okay.
 
Well,
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
it,
 
and
 
I'll
 
contact
 
you
 
once
 
I
 
do.
 
So
 
you
 
are
 
out
 
of
 
office
 
tomorrow
 
and
 
Thursday.
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
correct.
 
31:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Friday.
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
also
 
it
 
gives
 
you
 
a
 
time
 
to
 
think,
 
know,
 
40
 
hours.
 
That's
 
a
 
good
 
time
 
to
 
think.
 
31:37
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Yeah,
 
definitely.
 
31:38
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
if
 
you,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
I'll
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
you.
 
think
 
that
 
I
 
hate
 
is
 
chasing
 
potential
 
clients.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
decide,
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
decide
 
that,
 
ah,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
this,
 
this
 
is
 
too
 
risky,
 
or
 
that
 
you
 
don't
 
feel
 
like
 
ready
 
to
 
do
 
any
 
of
 
that,
 
just
 
tell
 
me,
 
Oriel,
 
I've
 
decided
 
to
 
not
 
move
 
forward.
 
But,
 
ah,
 
don't
 
ghost
 
me
 
or
 
anything
 
because
 
I
 
just,
 
I
 
hate
 
these
 
things.
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
fan
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
touch
 
base
 
with
 
you
 
on
 
Friday?
 
32:05
 
-
 
Hannah
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
send
 
me
 
a
 
message
 
on
 
Friday?
 
How
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
this?
 
Why
 
don't
 
you
 
message
 
me
 
on
 
Friday?
 
That's
 
probably
 
the
 
best
 
way
 
to
 
go
 
about
 
it.
 
Because
 
I
 
am
 
very
 
busy
 
and
 
I'll
 
probably
 
forget.
 
But
 
I
 
will
 
definitely
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
yes
 
or
 
no
 
answer
 
by
 
Friday.
 
32:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
100%.
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
research
 
on
 
your
 
area.
 
I
 
truly
 
do
 
believe.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
being
 
on
 
camera,
 
by
 
way?
 
No.
 
Okay,
 
great.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
truly
 
do
 
believe
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
grow
 
your
 
clinic
 
to
 
the
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
me
 
or
 
you'll
 
stop
 
the
 
ads.
 
I
 
don't
 
tell
 
that
 
to
 
people.
 
But
 
it
 
does
 
happen.
 
It
 
happens
 
to
 
me
 
all
 
the
 
time
 
with
 
clinics,
 
people
 
in
 
Israel
 
specifically.
 
But
 
yeah.
 
And
 
also
 
if
 
you
 
want,
 
I
 
can
 
send
 
you
 
a
 
video
 
because
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
me.
 
We've
 
been
 
on
 
this
 
call
 
for
 
30
 
minutes.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
video
 
that's
 
going
 
over
 
all
 
my
 
clients
 
in
 
Israel.
 
have
 
people
 
that
 
run
 
on
 
$600
 
a
 
day
 
budget,
 
$1,500
 
a
 
day,
 
like
 
insane
 
budgets.
 
And
 
ideally,
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
go
 
through
 
these
 
results.
 
You
 
can
 
go
 
look.
 
Take
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
them,
 
also
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
more,
 
like,
 
more
 
trust
 
inside
 
you.
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
great.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
This
 
video
 
was
 
for
 
a
 
different
 
clinic
 
owner,
 
so
 
it's
 
going
 
to,
 
he
 
was
 
a
 
male,
 
so
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
that
 
to
 
you.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
same
 
video,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
for
 
males,
 
so
 
just
 
ignore
 
that.
 
Is
 
that
 
cool?
 
Awesome.
 
Yeah,
 
I'd
 
love
 
to
 
see
 
that.
 
Great,
 
so
 
I
 
talked
 
a
 
lot,
 
I
 
hope
 
I
 
gave
 
you,
 
like,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
anything
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over,
 
like,
 
feel
 
free,
 
because
 
I
 
did
 
overwhelm.
 
33:27
 
-
 
Hannah
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
so,
 
but
 
if
 
anything
 
comes
 
up,
 
I'll
 
definitely
 
let
 
you
 
know.
 
33:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
100%,
 
so
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
videos.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
make
 
sure
 
to
 
let
 
me
 
know,
 
and
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
you
 
on
 
Friday.
 
Okay,
 
sounds
 
good.
 
Awesome,
 
Thank
 
you
 
so
 
much.
 
Have
 
a
 
good
 
day.
 
You
 
too.
 
Bye
 
bye.
 
Bye
 
bye.

This
 
meeting
 
is
 
being
 
recorded.
 
How's
 
it
 
going?
 
0:08
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
I'm
 
doing
 
well,
 
Oriel.
 
How
 
are
 
you?
 
0:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
good.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
I
 
told
 
you
 
that
 
my
 
father
 
has
 
passed
 
and
 
stuff.
 
You
 
said
 
he
 
had
 
cancer.
 
Yeah.
 
Not
 
nice,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
what
 
it
 
is.
 
He
 
did
 
prepare
 
us
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
Anyways,
 
no
 
depresso.
 
How
 
are
 
you
 
doing?
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
completely
 
straight
 
with
 
you.
 
As
 
you
 
know,
 
that's
 
how
 
I
 
am.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
idea
 
of
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
cost
 
per
 
booking,
 
landing
 
page
 
conversion,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff?
 
0:47
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
No
 
idea.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
meeting
 
with
 
them
 
later
 
on
 
today.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
getting
 
some
 
interest,
 
but
 
I
 
haven't
 
gotten
 
any
 
bookings
 
yet.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
just
 
went
 
live.
 
Maybe
 
two
 
and
 
a
 
half,
 
maybe
 
three
 
weeks
 
now.
 
1:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
I
 
was
 
trying
 
to
 
look
 
up
 
for
 
your
 
ads.
 
couldn't
 
find
 
them
 
for
 
some
 
reason,
 
even
 
though
 
it
 
was
 
supposed
 
to
 
be
 
pretty
 
simple.
 
1:10
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
You're
 
on
 
Facebook.

-
 
Oriel
 
Mor

Yeah,
 
yeah.
 
I
 
was
 
trying
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
from
 
your
 
page.
 
Seems
 
like
 
it's
 
probably
 
not
 
the
 
same
 
page.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
do
 
something
 
very
 
simple.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
exactly
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
and
 
everything
 
and
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
Like,
 
what's
 
the
 
trend?
 
Because
 
three
 
weeks
 
is
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
time
 
to
 
get
 
data.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
share
 
your
 
screen
 
if
 
you
 
want.
 
We
 
can
 
go
 
inside
 
the
 
ads
 
manager
 
and
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
there.

Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
Okay,
 
so
 
the
 
ads
 
manager
 
is
 
in
 
Facebook
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
the
 
platform?
 
1:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes,
 
that's
 
in
 
Facebook,
 
correct.
 
How
 
is
 
their
 
communication
 
and
 
everything?
 
1:49
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
Are
 
you
 
happy
 
with
 
that?
 
I
 
think
 
their
 
communication
 
is
 
good.
 
I
 
mean,
 
she's
 
been
 
checking
 
in
 
with
 
me
 
once
 
weekly.
 
So
 
we
 
were
 
supposed
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
check-in.
 
And
 
last
 
Thursday,
 
and
 
there
 
was
 
just
 
a
 
scheduling
 
conflict,
 
and
 
we
 
didn't
 
do
 
it.

Oriel

So
 
we're
 
doing
 
it
 
today.
 
That's
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
right?
 
Or
 
am
 
I
 
mistaken?
 
2:16
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna

What's
 
that?

Oriel

The
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
company
 
is
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
correct?
 
No,
 
no,
 
no.
 
It's
 
Patient
 
Plus,
 
right?
 
2:22
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,

Yeah.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
how
 
do
 
I

Okay,
 
I'm
 
a

No,
 
yeah,
 
a
 
webinar
 
is
 
like
 
a
 
live
 
event
 
thing,
 
which
 
is
 
very
 
good
 
if
 
you
 
run
 
that,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
you
 
actually
 
do.
 
It's
 
prerecorded.
 
Oh,
 
oh,
 
so
 
you
 
have
 
a

People
 
just

Yes,

okay,
 
so
 
seven

56
 
bucks,
 
you've
 
been

for
 
three

okay,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
the

there,
 
you

you

yep,

on

okay,
 
cool,
 
now
 
let's
 
go
 
see
 
the,
 
now,
 
when
 
you
 
hover
 
on
 
results
 
from
 
five
 
campaigns,
 
hover
 
over
 
on
 
that,
 
and
 
then
 
it's
 
gonna
 
show
 
you
 
like,
 
a
 
view,
 
a
 
mini
 
view
 
results
 
thingy.
 
Where?
 
Hover
 
over
 
the
 
results
 
from
 
five
 
campaigns,
 
yep,
 
press
 
on

what
 
is
 
that?
 
on
 
the

you
 
can

you

this

nope,
 
nope,
 
go
 
down,
 
scroll

not

from
 
five

right,
 
yep,
 
view

Boom.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
since
 
you
 
guys
 
started,
 
if
 
I'm
 
not
 
mistaken,
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
you
 
have
 
spent
 
1,400
 
bucks
 
on
 
ads.
 
From
 
that,
 
you
 
got
 
17
 
leads.
 
These
 
are
 
not
 
good
 
results,
 
Ayanna,
 
especially
 
for
 
a
 
webinar.
 
It's
 
not
 
that
 
people,
 
like,
 
is
 
it
 
a
 
landing?
 
It's
 
not
 
even,
 
do
 
people
 
sign
 
up
 
on
 
a
 
Facebook
 
form,
 
it
 
seems?
 
It
 
doesn't
 
even
 
seem
 
like
 
they
 
sign
 
up
 
on
 
a
 
landing
 
page.
 
Is
 
that
 
correct?
 
Oriel?
 
You
 
have
 
no
 
idea.

Dr.

This

the

they

reason,

one.
 
Yes,

right.
 
And
 
checkbox

Okay,

something
 
else.
 
No,

on

Yes.
 
Cool,
 
now
 
press
 
on
 
the

And
 
share
 
a

And
 
now
 
let's
 
go
 
to
 
the

press
 
on
 
the

itself.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
in
 
the

for
 
people
 
logging
 
in
 
on
 
Facebook?
 
Yes,
 
press
 
on
 
that.
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
preview.
 
Got
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah,
 
Here
 
So
 
I
 
understand
 
why
 
we
 
cannot
 
see
 
or...
 
Okay,
 
they're
 
using
 
their
 
Facebook
 
page.
 
I
 
understand
 
why
 
this
 
doesn't
 
work.
 
Yeah,
 
these
 
ads
 
are
 
just
 
not
 
doing
 
the
 
job
 
that
 
they're
 
supposed
 
to
 
do.
 
It's
 
very
 
simple.
 
We
 
talked
 
about
 
that
 
in
 
our
 
first
 
or
 
second
 
meeting.
 
Like
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
use
 
the
 
ads,
 
like
 
the
 
video
 
ads,
 
the
 
messaging.
 
Like
 
these
 
caps,
 
this
 
AI
 
image
 
thing,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
add
 
value
 
to
 
anybody's
 
life.
 
It
 
just
 
doesn't
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
say
 
that
 
there's
 
a
 
breakthrough
 
depression
 
treatment,
 
and
 
people
 
are
 
labeled
 
as
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression
 
people,
 
they
 
don't
 
care.
 
They
 
don't
 
care
 
whether,
 
you
 
know,
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
explain
 
to
 
them
 
exactly
 
what
 
makes
 
this
 
a
 
breakthrough
 
treatment.
 
Why
 
it's
 
better
 
than
 
other
 
things.
 
breakthrough
 
routine
 
Show
 
them
 
studies.
 
Show
 
them
 
results.
 
You
 
have
 
results.
 
You
 
literally
 
have
 
testimonials
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
they
 
probably
 
didn't
 
even
 
leverage
 
that.
 
So,
 
there's
 
many,
 
many
 
things
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
with
 
the
 
ads,
 
the
 
creative.
 
13:13

Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,

you
 
need

Oriel
 
Mor

I
 
don't
 
know
 
why
 
they
 
don't
 
use
 
your
 
own
 
page.
 
13:16

Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
Hold
 
on
 
one
 
second.
 
Oriel,
 
hold
 
on
 
one
 
second,
 
please.
 
Okay,
 
I'm
 
doing
 
it
 
right
 
now.
 
I
 
forgot
 
when
 
you
 
left.
 
What's
 
that?
 
Okay,
 
I'll
 
send
 
it
 
right
 
now.
 
Thanks.
 
Bye.
 
Love
 
you.
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
they're
 
using
 
their
 
page.
 
13:39

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
They're
 
not
 
using
 
my
 
page.
 
Mm-hmm.
 
That's
 
correct.
 
And
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
this
 
to
 
come
 
out
 
like
 
I'm
 
shitting
 
on
 
them,
 
okay?
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
this
 
to
 
be
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
That's
 
extremely
 
important
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
note.
 
I'm
 
just
 
telling
 
you
 
from
 
experience,
 
their
 
ads,
 
they're
 
just
 
not
 
good.
 
That's
 
a
 
fact,
 
okay?
 
I
 
can
 
show
 
you
 
another
 
clinics
 
ad.
 
13:59

Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
I
 
have...
 
I
 
gotten,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
haven't
 
gotten
 
any,
 
you
 
know,
 
lead
 
from
 
them.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
haven't
 
gotten
 
anything
 
that
 
translated
 
into
 
money,
 
basically.
 
So
 
it's,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
not
 
hard
 
to
 
see.
 
I
 
think
 
I'm
 
coming
 
up
 
on,
 
where
 
do
 
I
 
see
 
when
 
it
 
went
 
live?

Yes.
 
Yes,

press

all,
 
oh,
 
actually,
 
we
 
don't
 
even
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
it,
 
no,
 
it
 
got
 
published
 
on
 
the
 
15th
 
of
 
August.
 
very
 
much.
 
On
 
the
 
15th
 
of
 
August.
 
So
 
basically
 
almost
 
a
 
month.
 
You
 
got
 
in
 
a
 
month,
 
you
 
got
 
17
 
leads
 
in
 
a
 
month,
 
which
 
is,
 
honestly,
 
Ayanna,
 
have
 
to
 
be,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
honest,
 
it's
 
trash.
 
Okay?
 
Like,
 
that's
 
not,
 
no.
 
And
 
there's
 
also
 
like
 
systems
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
implemented.
 
Like
 
I
 
told
 
you,
 
like
 
calling
 
leads
 
within
 
five
 
minutes,
 
make
 
sure
 
the
 
booking,
 
the
 
booking
 
times
 
is
 
like
 
three
 
days
 
ahead
 
max,
 
giving
 
them
 
value,
 
you
 
know,
 
all
 
these
 
things
 
using
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
that
 
you
 
got.
 
The
 
thing
 
is,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
you
 
got
 
17
 
leads
 
from
 
a
 
landing
 
page.
 
Okay.
 
You
 
got
 
17
 
leads
 
from
 
a
 
form
 
on
 
Meta,
 
which
 
means
 
people
 
don't
 
even
 
leave
 
Facebook.
 
Okay.
 
Just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
get
 
some
 
context,
 
I
 
can
 
share
 
my
 
screen
 
and
 
show
 
you.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
clinic
 
in
 
Arkansas
 
that
 
we
 
started
 
working
 
with.
 
In
 
a
 
month
 
and
 
a
 
half,
 
we
 
got
 
140
 
leads
 
from
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
with
 
filtering
 
questions.
 
Which
 
means
 
it's
 
only
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
diagnosed
 
with
 
depression.
 
We
 
know
 
how
 
many
 
medications
 
they
 
take.
 
We
 
know
 
if
 
they've
 
had
 
an
 
adverse
 
reaction
 
to
 
ketamine
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
know
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
The
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
10
 
bucks.
 
10
 
bucks.
 
And
 
it's
 
not
 
just
 
leads.
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
again
 
the
 
messaging.
 
And
 
also
 
he's
 
doing
 
everything
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you.
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you
 
to
 
film
 
videos
 
as
 
he's
 
filming
 
them.
 
He
 
has
 
a
 
front
 
desk
 
team.
 
They're
 
optimizing
 
things.
 
Like
 
they're
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
.
 
Which,
 
you
 
know,
 
people
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
they
 
do
 
in
 
the
 
check-in
 
calls,
 
but...
 
That's
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
fearing
 
the
 
most.
 
Okay,
 
I
 
didn't...
 
18:34
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
So
 
what's
 
been
 
happening
 
is
 
I
 
get
 
a
 
message
 
and
 
I
 
try
 
to
 
basically
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
message.
 
I
 
came
 
up
 
like
 
with
 
a
 
text
 
message.
 
So
 
if
 
I'm
 
with
 
the
 
patient,
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
respond.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
send
 
them
 
an
 
email
 
and
 
I
 
try
 
to
 
reach
 
out
 
by
 
phone.
 
But
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
times
 
they're
 
like,
 
oh,
 
if
 
I
 
call
 
them
 
by
 
phone,
 
they're
 
not...
 
They're
 
like,
 
oh,
 
can
 
you
 
call
 
me
 
back?
 
And
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
maybe
 
I
 
was
 
wrong.
 
I
 
don't
 
have...
 
I
 
Like,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
time
 
to
 
just
 
run
 
around
 
and
 
call
 
people.
 
So
 
maybe
 
that's
 
just
 
on
 
me
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
staff.
 
I
 
mean,
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
but
 
to
 
me,
 
like
 
doctors
 
don't
 
chase
 
down
 
patients,
 
you
 
know,
 
patients
 
come
 
in
 
because
 
they
 
need
 
help
 
and
 
they're,
 
you
 
know,
 
my,
 
I
 
think
 
my,
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
my
 
job
 
is
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
easy
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
get
 
help
 
by
 
having
 
a
 
system
 
in
 
place.
 
Okay.
 
Here's
 
the
 
first
 
thing,
 
fill
 
out
 
this.
 
We
 
can
 
verify
 
your
 
insurance.
 
Okay.
 
You,
 
if
 
your
 
insurance
 
is
 
verified,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
next
 
step.
 
Let's
 
get
 
you
 
scheduled.
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
that's
 
my
 
job.
 
Job
 
of
 
the
 
clinic
 
is
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
process
 
easy,
 
but
 
calling
 
people
 
like
 
I'm
 
some
 
telemarketer
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
20.

Like,
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
just,
 
I'm
 
just
 
not
 
really
 
feeling
 
it.
 
Um,
 
so
 
I
 
may
 
just,
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
meet,
 
I
 
have,
 
I'm
 
supposed
 
to
 
meet
 
with
 
her
 
today.
 
Um,
 
so,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm,
 
I
 
definitely.
 
I
 
definitely
 
planned
 
on
 
telling
 
her
 
I
 
wasn't
 
really,
 
you
 
know,
 
all
 
that
 
enthusiastic
 
about,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
has
 
transpired,
 
because
 
it
 
hasn't
 
led
 
to
 
any
 
money,
 
it
 
hasn't
 
translated
 
to
 
any
 
money.
 
I've
 
spent
 
money
 
and
 
I'm
 
not
 
making
 
any
 
money.
 
And
 
so
 
that's,
 
that's
 
not,
 
that's
 
not
 
sustainable
 
at
 
all.

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
Now,
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
with
 
calling
 
the
 
leads,
 
with
 
calling
 
the
 
leads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
there's
 
two
 
things
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
place.
 
One
 
thing
 
is
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
send
 
the
 
personalized
 
message
 
right
 
after
 
they
 
come
 
in.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
send
 
them
 
a
 
calendar
 
link
 
to
 
book
 
with
 
your
 
calendar.
 
That's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
do.
 
Like
 
there's
 
40%
 
of
 
people
 
book
 
on
 
their
 
own.
 
And
 
if
 
they
 
don't
 
book,
 
okay,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
follow
 
up,
 
you
 
know,
 
messages
 
in
 
place.
 
And
 
also,
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
should
 
have,
 
didn't
 
you
 
say
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
like
 
a,
 
um,
 
an
 
intern
 
that
 
can
 
call
 
the
 
leads
 
herself?
 
20:53
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
do.
 
But
 
she's
 
back
 
in
 
school
 
now.
 
That's
 
my
 
daughter,
 
you
 
know,
 
call
 
it
 
like
 
that.
 
But
 
I
 
mean,
 
she's
 
high
 
school.
 
So
 
now
 
school
 
is
 
back
 
in
 
session.
 
21:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
she's
 
not
 
really
 
as
 
available.
 
21:06
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
But
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
came
 
up
 
with
 
like
 
a
 
text
 
message,
 
like
 
that
 
I
 
could
 
send
 
right
 
away.
 
So
 
that
 
if
 
I'm
 
even
 
if
 
I'm
 
with
 
the
 
patient,
 
I've
 
got
 
a
 
pinned
 
text
 
message.
 
And
 
it
 
says,
 
thank
 
you
 
for
 
contacting
 
Nirvana

it's
 
not
 
even
 
automatic?
 
21:49
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
No,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 
21:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What?
 
No,
 
Ayanna,
 
this
 
is
 
not.
 
No.
 
21:54
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
No.
 
21:55

Oriel

No.
 
21:57

Dr.
 
Ayanna

No.
 
No.
 
No.
 
21:58

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No.
 
There's,
 
there's
 
platforms
 
that
 
we
 
use
 
for
 
that.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
mean?
 
There's
 
so
 
many,
 
we're
 
20,
 
25.
 
And
 
also
 
for
 
the,
 
for
 
the,
 
um,
 
for
 
calling
 
the
 
leads,
 
there's,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's
 
basically
 
an
 
AI
 
agent
 
that
 
can
 
call
 
the
 
leads
 
and
 
it
 
sounds
 
like
 
a
 
human.
 
You
 
can
 
literally
 
implement
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
The
 
fact
 
that
 
it
 
doesn't
 
even
 
send
 
the
 
messages
 
automatically,
 
it's
 
not,
 
it's,
 
it's,
 
this
 
isn't,
 
this
 
isn't
 
something
 
they
 
created.
 
22:25
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
This
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
way
 
I,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
created
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
respond.
 
22:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
what
 
did
 
they
 
do?
 
22:31
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
guess
 
they
 
ran,
 
they
 
ran
 
the
 
ads.
 
They,
 
they
 
ran
 
the
 
ads.
 
I
 
mean,
 
they,
 
they
 
responded
 
to
 
the
 
leads
 
while
 
I
 
was
 
on
 
vacation,
 
but
 
there's
 
like
 
a
 
platform.
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
the
 
little
 
place
 
where
 
I
 
go
 
to
 
check
 
the
 
leads
 
out
 
and
 
everything?
 
22:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
sure.
 
That
 
would
 
be
 
very,
 
that's
 
extremely
 
important.
 
If
 
I
 
think,
 
if
 
it
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
is.
 
22:58
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
Thank
 
you.
 
So
 
can
 
I
 
close
 
out
 
this
 
ads
 
manager
 
stuff?
 
23:06
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
yeah,
 
yeah,
 
you
 
can
 
close
 
it.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
got
 
what
 
I
 
saw
 
what
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
see.
 
23:34

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
yeah,
 
let's
 
go
 
high
 
level.
 
That's
 
what
 
I
 
thought.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
sending,
 
like
 
when
 
people
 
leave
 
their
 
details,
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
sending
 
the
 
messages
 
automatically.
 
It's
 
possible
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
with
 
go
 
high
 
level.
 
Also,
 
yeah,
 
you
 
can
 
manage
 
leads
 
from
 
the
 
opportunities.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
Pipeline,
 
and
 
they
 
also,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
app?
 
Do
 
have
 
the
 
app?
 
No.
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
there's
 
also
 
an
 
app
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
the
 
app.
 
You
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
on
 
your
 
computer
 
all
 
the
 
time.
 
I
 
have
 
like
 
a
 
training
 
on
 
the
 
app
 
itself.
 
If
 
you
 
want,
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
send
 
you
 
that.
 
You
 
can
 
basically
 
do
 
everything
 
from
 
the
 
app.
 
There's
 
automations
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
when
 
people
 
are
 
in
 
specific
 
pipeline
 
stages.
 
You
 
can
 
add
 
tags.
 
You
 
can
 
literally
 
call
 
people
 
as
 
well
 
from
 
the
 
app
 
itself.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
phone
 
number
 
on
 
the
 
app.
 
You
 
can
 
call
 
people
 
from
 
the
 
app
 
itself,
 
which
 
is
 
also
 
very
 
important
 
in
 
order
 
to,
 
because
 
you
 
can
 
record
 
the
 
calls.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
use
 
these
 
calls
 
as
 
data
 
for
 
the
 
voice
 
AI
 
agent
 
and
 
just
 
optimize
 
it.
 
So
 
there's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
call
 
leads
 
anymore.
 
The
 
AI
 
does
 
all
 
the
 
work.
 
It
 
books
 
people
 
in
 
your
 
calendar
 
and
 
you
 
just
 
see
 
it.
 
And
 
it
 
sends
 
them
 
reminders
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
as
 
well.
 
So
 
the
 
whole
 
process
 
can
 
be
 
way
 
more
 
automatic.
 
And
 
you're
 
at
 
least
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
way
 
more
 
qualified.
 
I
 
know.
 
Like
 
if
 
you
 
remember
 
like
 
our
 
dynamic
 
from
 
when
 
we
 
talked
 
like
 
two,
 
three
 
months
 
ago,
 
you're
 
supposed
 
to
 
know
 
that
 
when
 
I
 
say
 
things,
 
there's
 
purpose
 
to
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
say,
 
okay?
 
And
 
I'm
 
genuinely,
 
genuinely
 
telling
 
you
 
these
 
results
 
are
 
not
 
good.
 
You
 
are
 
burning
 
money.
 
You're
 
burning
 
money,
 
okay?
 
And
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you
 
with
 
100%
 
confidence
 
I
 
can
 
survive
 
my
 
mom's
 
life,
 
my
 
brother's
 
life,
 
everybody's
 
life,
 
my
 
girlfriend's
 
life,
 
and
 
I
 
love
 
these
 
people
 
to
 
death,
 
okay?
 
I
 
would
 
die
 
for
 
these
 
people,
 
that
 
you
 
would
 
get
 
so
 
much
 
better
 
results
 
if
 
you
 
literally
 
started
 
working
 
with
 
me
 
without
 
even
 
paying
 
me
 
money.
 
And
 
the
 
reason
 
that
 
I
 
didn't
 
even
 
take
 
money
 
is
 
because
 
of
 
my
 
own
 
like
 
insecurity,
 
not
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
do.
 
That's
 
the
 
only
 
reason.
 
And
 
because
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
prove
 
to
 
myself
 
that
 
what
 
I've
 
done
 
with
 
people
 
in
 
Israel,
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
do
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
in
 
the
 
US.
 
And
 
now
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
these
 
are
 
my
 
competitors,
 
well,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
it
 
boosts
 
my
 
confidence
 
like
 
to
 
different
 
levels.
 
26:00
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
Listen.
 
Listen.
 
I
 
figured
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
things
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
out
 
this
 
call.
 
I
 
like
 
you
 
as
 
a
 
person,
 
but
 
I
 
know
 
in
 
part
 
you're
 
gathering
 
information
 
about
 
your
 
competitors.
 
And
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
that.
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
we've
 
had
 
a,
 
you
 
know,
 
I've
 
enjoyed
 
talking
 
to
 
you.
 
I've
 
enjoyed
 
working
 
with
 
you.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
in
 
general,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
you
 
that
 
well,
 
but
 
I
 
like
 
you.
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
sharing
 
the
 
information.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
something
 
out
 
of
 
it.
 
You
 
can
 
get
 
something
 
out
 
of
 
it
 
because
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
you're
 
telling
 
me
 
the
 
truth
 
and
 
you're
 
learning
 
something.
 
But
 
we
 
were
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
today
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
ask
 
her,
 
like,
 
okay,
 
so
 
when
 
is
 
this
 
supposed
 
to
 
start
 
working?
 
Because,
 
you
 
know,
 
I've
 
already
 
spent
 
about
 
$3,000.
 
So
 
when
 
is
 
it
 
going
 
to
 
work?
 
Because
 
that's
 
not
 
sustainable
 
for
 
me.
 
That's
 
not
 
sustainable
 
to
 
spend
 
$3,000
 
for
 
months
 
on
 
end
 
and
 
just
 
to
 
wait
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
this
 
works.
 
26:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it's
 
not.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
agree
 
with
 
you.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
steps
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
fix
 
all
 
of
 
this.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
action
 
plan
 
in
 
mind.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
do.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
here.
 
27:05
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
So
 
what
 
is
 
your
 
proposal?
 
27:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
go
 
on
 
the
 
call
 
with
 
them
 
today.
 
See
 
what
 
they
 
propose.
 
Honestly,
 
she's
 
probably
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
you,
 
okay?
 
Saying,
 
oh,
 
we
 
need
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
optimize
 
or
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah.
 
But
 
no,
 
I've
 
seen
 
the
 
ads.
 
I've
 
seen
 
the
 
copy.
 
I
 
understand.
 
I
 
know
 
the,
 
I
 
know
 
it's
 
not,
 
and
 
you
 
say
 
I've,
 
like,
 
hopped
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
to
 
gather
 
information
 
about
 
my
 
competitors
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
there's
 
something
 
I
 
can
 
do.
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
feeling
 
something.
 
I
 
don't,
 
like.
 
27:37
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
No,
 
no,
 
no.
 
I'm
 
not
 
accusing
 
you
 
of
 
doing
 
anything
 
malicious
 
or
 
underhanded.
 
27:42
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
important.
 
That's
 
important.
 
27:44
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
No,
 
and
 
that's
 
not
 
what
 
I'm
 
saying.
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
another
 
clinic
 
and
 
they
 
were
 
doing
 
something
 
that
 
I
 
did,
 
it's
 
just
 
common
 
sense
 
to
 
say,
 
oh,
 
look
 
how
 
they're
 
doing
 
it.
 
It's
 
working
 
or
 
it's
 
not
 
working.
 
So,
 
I'm
 
not
 
accusing
 
you
 
of
 
being,
 
doing
 
anything
 
malicious.
 
I'm
 
not.
 
That's
 
not
 
what
 
I'm
 
saying.
 
I'm
 
just
 
saying,
 
I
 
understand,
 
you
 
know,
 
when
 
you
 
said,
 
oh,
 
let
 
me
 
see.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
they're
 
doing.
 
They're
 
your
 
competitor.
 
You
 
think
 
if
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
another
 
ketamine
 
clinic,
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
look
 
and
 
see,
 
oh,
 
how
 
they
 
did
 
that.
 
I
 
mean,
 
Spravato
 
sent
 
me
 
for
 
training
 
down
 
in
 
Dallas.
 
And,
 
I
 
mean,
 
that
 
was
 
the
 
whole
 
purpose.
 
They
 
want
 
us
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
other
 
clinics
 
are
 
doing
 
it.
 
And
 
I
 
did.
 
I
 
took
 
stuff
 
from
 
what
 
they
 
were
 
doing,
 
a
 
very
 
successful
 
clinic.
 
I
 
can
 
learn
 
things
 
from
 
a
 
successful
 
clinic.

You
 
can
 
learn
 
things
 
from
 
an
 
unsuccessful
 
clinic,
 
right?
 
28:35
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
So
 
that's
 
all
 
I'm
 
saying.
 
I
 
understand.
 
Like,
 
you
 
can
 
learn
 
something
 
from
 
this.
 
You,
 
like,
 
you
 
get
 
reinforcement.
 
Okay.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
definitely
 
see
 
that's
 
not
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do,
 
right?
 
So
 
that's
 
all
 
I'm
 
saying.
 
I'm
 
not
 
accusing
 
you
 
of
 
being,
 
like,
 
malicious
 
or
 
sneaky
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
28:51

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
So,
 
basically,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
extremely
 
direct.
 
My
 
proposal
 
is
 
very
 
simple.
 
You
 
can
 
go
 
on
 
a
 
call.
 
Both
 
of
 
them,
 
the
 
check-in
 
person,
 
whoever,
 
what
 
she
 
does,
 
she's
 
probably
 
going
 
to
 
you
 
because
 
she
 
has
 
no,
 
she,
 
from
 
what
 
I
 
see,
 
they
 
have
 
no
 
real
 
knowledge
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
run
 
ads
 
and
 
what
 
goes
 
through
 
ads
 
and
 
what
 
makes
 
ads
 
successful,
 
which
 
is
 
very
 
sad
 
because
 
that
 
means
 
they
 
don't
 
understand
 
how
 
business
 
works,
 
okay?
 
Because
 
if
 
you
 
run
 
ads
 
like
 
these
 
and
 
you
 
get
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
results
 
and
 
you
 
don't
 
implement
 
insane
 
changes
 
when
 
you
 
see
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
results
 
and
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
they
 
did
 
was
 
just
 
duplicate
 
the
 
campaign,
 
which
 
is
 
stupid,
 
honestly,
 
it's
 
stupid.
 
Then
 
the
 
results
 
are
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
change
 
because
 
there's
 
a
 
fundamental
 
problem
 
with
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
they
 
run
 
the
 
operation,
 
okay?
 
The
 
thing
 
is
 
that
 
most
 
people
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
campaign
 
itself
 
or
 
the
 
targeting
 
because
 
you
 
saw
 
they
 
have,
 
you
 
saw
 
they
 
had
 
like
 
10
 
adsets
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I
 
only
 
use
 
one.
 
I
 
use
 
one
 
ad
 
set,
 
okay?
 
And
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
multiple
 
ad
 
sets,
 
the
 
multiple
 
adsets
 
are
 
not
 
to
 
test
 
targeting,
 
they're
 
not
 
to
 
test
 
the
 
area
 
or
 
the
 
zip
 
code,
 
it's
 
to
 
test
 
creative,
 
okay?
 
It
 
tests
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
messaging
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
works.
 
And
 
if
 
doesn't
 
work,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
create
 
new
 
and
 
test
 
new
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
the
 
other
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
That's
 
how
 
it
 
goes.
 
And
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
automations
 
in
 
place.
 
The
 
fact
 
that
 
they
 
didn't
 
even
 
place
 
an
 
automation
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
send
 
information,
 
to
 
send
 
an
 
automated
 
message
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
lead,
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
send
 
the
 
message
 
yourself,
 
like
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
manual
 
press
 
on
 
something,
 
and
 
even
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
copy-paste,
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
is
 
stupid.
 
It's
 
just
 
stupid,
 
honestly.
 
So,
 
my
 
proposal
 
is
 
very
 
simple.
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
literally
 
double,
 
triple,
 
or
 
even
 
quadruple
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
leads
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
if
 
you
 
start
 
working
 
with
 
me.
 
And
 
that's
 
the
 
main
 
challenge
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
here
 
is,
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
thing
 
which
 
basically
 
hurts
 
me
 
as
 
a
 
businessman,
 
I
 
guess
 
you
 
could
 
say,
 
because
 
you
 
spend
 
so
 
much
 
money
 
and
 
you
 
got
 
basically
 
from
 
them,
 
and
 
they're
 
probably
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
even
 
send
 
you
 
your
 
money
 
back
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
that,
 
then
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
difficult
 
time
 
charging
 
you
 
money.
 
But
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
charge
 
money,
 
okay?
 
So
 
what
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
very
 
simple.
 
We
 
can
 
have
 
a
 
contract
 
set
 
in
 
place
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
hit
 
a
 
specific
 
KPI
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
month.
 
We
 
either
 
want
 
an
 
amount
 
of
 
leads,
 
an
 
amount
 
of
 
book
 
consultations,
 
okay?
 
Book
 
consultations
 
in
 
your
 
calendar.
 
If
 
we
 
don't
 
reach
 
that
 
amount,
 
I
 
work
 
for
 
free.
 
It's
 
very
 
simple,
 
okay?
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
exactly,
 
okay?
 
Before
 
we
 
start,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
analyze
 
exactly
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
numbers
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
hit
 
in
 
order
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
be
 
profitable.
 
Because
 
there's
 
a
 
specific
 
type
 
of
 
number,
 
okay?
 
A
 
specific
 
type
 
of
 
threshold
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
reach,
 
okay?
 
For
 
example,
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
think
 
of
 
an
 
example.
 
So
 
let's
 
say,
 
okay,
 
let's
 
create
 
a
 
simulation
 
here,
 
okay?
 
Let's
 
say
 
that
 
you
 
get
 
100
 
leads.
 
let's
 
let's
 
let's
 
From
 
these
 
100
 
leads,
 
you
 
get
 
20
 
people
 
booking.
 
From
 
these
 
20
 
people
 
booking,
 
there's
 
10
 
people
 
that
 
show
 
up.
 
Cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
$15,
 
which
 
means
 
that
 
you
 
spend
 
$1,500
 
on
 
the
 
ads.
 
Let's
 
do
 
this
 
in
 
a
 
doc,
 
so
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
simpler.

Just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
my
 
brain
 
works,
 
okay,
 
business-wise.
 
So,
 
oh,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
right
 
one,
 
though.
 
Just
 
a
 
sec.
 
Where
 
is
 
that?
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
That's
 
it.
 
So
 
let's
 
do
 
a
 
mini-simulation
 
here.
 
Let's
 
say
 
that
 
we
 
do
 
the
 
first
 
month,
 
and
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
set
 
KPIs,
 
and
 
I'm
 
just
 
doing
 
random
 
numbers
 
here.
 
What's
 
a
 
KPI?
 
Key
 
Performance
 
Indicator.
 
The
 
Key
 
Performance
 
Indicator
 
is
 
basically
 
your
 
north
 
star
 
to
 
understand
 
whether
 
your
 
ads
 
are
 
working
 
or
 
they're
 
not
 
working.
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
we're
 
in
 
business
 
here.
 
We're
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
fields
 
game.
 
We're
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
game.
 
So,
 
we
 
say
 
100
 
leads.
 
We
 
get
 
our
 
100
 
leads,
 
you
 
spend
 
$1,500.
 
That
 
means
 
that
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
CPL,
 
is
 
$15,
 
okay?
 
Now
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
from
 
these
 
$15,
 
we
 
have
 
20
 
people
 
that
 
booked,
 
okay?
 
So
 
if
 
there's
 
22
 
people
 
that
 
booked,
 
that
 
means
 
20
 
booked.
 
Cost
 
per
 
booking
 
is,
 
CPB,
 
is
 
$1,500
 
divided
 
by
 
$20.75.
 
Is
 
that
 
correct?
 
Right?

you
 
say
 
so,
 
I'm
 
not.

You're
 
not
 
on
 
math
 
thing,
 
okay.
 
So
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
from
 
these
 
20
 
bookings,
 
get
 
10
 
patients
 
that
 
show
 
up.
 
Okay,
 
10
 
patients
 
show
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
clinic,
 
10
 
show
 
up.
 
Which
 
means
 
that
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
show,
 
per
 
CPS,
 
cost
 
per
 
show
 
is
 
$150.
 
And
 
let's
 
say
 
from
 
these
 
10
 
people,
 
you
 
close
 
three
 
people,
 
okay,
 
on
 
the
 
treatment.
 
So
 
that
 
means
 
that
 
the,
 
say,
 
three
 
people
 
closed.
 
That
 
means
 
that
 
we
 
get
 
a
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition,
 
which
 
is
 
the...
 
The
 
most
 
important
 
number
 
in
 
your
 
business,
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition,
 
is
 
how
 
much
 
you
 
pay
 
to
 
close
 
a
 
client,
 
is
 
$450.
 
Now,
 
what
 
the
 
do
 
these
 
numbers
 
mean,
 
okay?
 
They
 
don't
 
mean
 
jack
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
understand
 
the
 
numbers
 
in
 
your
 
backend.
 
So,
 
you
 
spent
 
$450
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
customer.
 
Is
 
that
 
profitable
 
to
 
you?
 
Based
 
on
 
what
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
and
 
that
 
your
 
treatment
 
package
 
is
 
$3,000,
 
correct
 
me
 
if
 
I'm
 
wrong,
 
something
 
like
 
that,
 
$2,500
 
through
 
$3,000.
 
Yes,
 
that's
 
profitable,
 
okay?
 
So,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
understand,
 
okay,
 
so
 
if
 
our
 
lifetime
 
value,
 
okay,
 
or
 
say
 
average
 
order,
 
okay,
 
let's
 
do
 
lifetime
 
value,
 
which
 
is
 
how
 
much
 
a
 
patient
 
pays
 
you
 
in
 
general,
 
is
 
$3,000,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
really
 
correct
 
because
 
they
 
do
 
have
 
the
 
maintenance
 
sessions
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So,
 
it
 
just
 
gets
 
more
 
and
 
more
 
and
 
more,
 
but
 
let's
 
say
 
$3,000
 
on
 
the
 
low
 
end.
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
if
 
our
 
lifetime
 
value
 
is
 
$3,000,
 
how
 
much,
 
like,
 
what's
 
the
 
maximum?
 
What
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
to
 
acquire
 
a
 
customer?
 
In
 
your
 
sense,
 
how
 
much
 
are
 
you
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
to
 
acquire
 
a
 
customer
 
if
 
your
 
lifetime
 
value
 
is
 
$3,000?
 
When
 
would
 
it
 
stop
 
being
 
profitable
 
for
 
you?
 
35:18
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
When
 
would
 
it
 
stop
 
being
 
profitable
 
for
 
me?
 
Well,
 
I
 
mean,
 
this
 
is
 
to
 
acquire
 
the
 
patient.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
figure
 
if
 
I
 
sold
 
a
 
$3,000
 
package,
 
that's
 
six
 
sessions.
 
So,
 
I
 
mean,
 
just
 
calculating
 
my
 
time,
 
I
 
would
 
want
 
to
 
clear.
 
I
 
guess,
 
like,
 
I
 
would
 
definitely
 
want
 
to
 
clear
 
$1,500
 
for
 
each
 
session.
 
So,
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
of
 
it,
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
of
 
it
 
in
 
terms
 
of,
 
like,
 
how
 
much
 
I
 
make.
 
I
 
about
 
$2.50
 
to
 
$2.70.
 
I
 
make
 
between
 
$2.75
 
to
 
$3.05
 
per
 
session
 
off
 
of
 
insurance.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
keep
 
that
 
up.
 
And
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
that
 
makes
 
sense
 
to
 
you.
 
So
 
somebody's
 
sitting
 
in
 
my
 
office,
 
they
 
come
 
in
 
for
 
treatment,
 
a
 
two-hour
 
treatment.
 
I
 
make
 
somewhere
 
between
 
$2.75
 
to
 
$3.05
 
off
 
of
 
the
 
person.
 
And
 
then
 
for
 
me,
 
what
 
really
 
makes
 
it
 
profitable
 
is
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
three
 
chairs
 
and
 
all
 
three
 
chairs
 
are
 
filled
 
up.
 
So
 
now
 
I'm
 
making
 
for
 
that
 
two
 
hours,
 
I'm
 
making
 
just
 
say
 
on
 
the
 
low
 
end,
 
$2.75
 
times
 
three
 
people,
 
$8.25.
 
36:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
$8.25
 
I've
 
made
 
in
 
two
 
hours.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
let's
 
do
 
a
 
little
 
reset
 
here.
 
So
 
you
 
say
 
that
 
you're
 
getting
 
paid
 
$2.70
 
between
 
$3.05.
 
That's
 
your
 
profit.
 
36:57
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
That's
 
your
 
like
 
clean
 
profit,
 
correct?
 
Yeah,
 
$2.70.

Okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
time.
 
So
 
the
 
LTV
 
is
 
not
 
3000
 
because
 
what
 
an
 
important
 
thing
 
to
 
note
 
with
 
LTV
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
lifetime
 
gross
 
profit.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
off
 
what
 
you
 
get
 
deducted
 
from
 
it,
 
because
 
the
 
LTV
 
is
 
the
 
revenue
 
itself.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
profit,
 
because
 
that's
 
what
 
you
 
care
 
about.
 
Nobody
 
cares
 
about
 
revenue,
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
any
 
profit.
 
So
 
let's
 
say
 
that
 
it's
 
290.
 
Let's
 
put
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
290
 
x
 
6.
 
That's
 
approximately
 
17,
 
1750,
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
Yeah,
 
1750.
 
1740.
 
Let's
 
do
 
1750.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
1750.
 
That's
 
your
 
profit.
 
So
 
from
 
that,
 
and
 
that's
 
for
 
one
 
person.
 
Yeah,
 
let's
 
just
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
LTV
 
from
 
a
 
one
 
person
 
perspective.
 
If
 
you
 
fill
 
out
 
three
 
chairs,
 
great,
 
but
 
we're
 
still
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
profit
 
per
 
person.
 
That's
 
what
 
we
 
care
 
about.
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
it's
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
per
 
person,
 
not
 
per
 
three
 
people.
 
So
 
1750,
 
that's
 
your
 
lifetime
 
value.
 
So
 
when
 
is
 
it
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
profitable
 
for
 
us?
 
Like,
 
what's
 
the
 
maximum
 
amount
 
that
 
you're
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
to
 
acquire
 
for
 
us?
 
That's
 
the
 
simple
 
question.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
say
 
like,
 
Oriel,
 
listen,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
over
 
a
 
CPA
 
of
 
700
 
bucks.
 
Over
 
that,
 
I'm
 
making
 
$1,000
 
profit.
 
Anything
 
less
 
than
 
that,
 
it's
 
not
 
worth
 
my
 
time.
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
off
 
the
 
CPA.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
off
 
the
 
CPA
 
of
 
the
 
450,
 
and
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$1,300.
 
And
 
now
 
you
 
divide
 
that
 
by
 
six,
 
and
 
that
 
equals
 
your
 
profit
 
per
 
session.
 
Okay?
 
That
 
equals
 
your
 
profit
 
per
 
session,
 
which
 
is
 
approximately
 
$220
 
of
 
profit
 
per
 
session.
 
And
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
include
 
is
 
the
 
money
 
that
 
you're
 
paying
 
me.
 
You're
 
also
 
paying
 
me
 
money
 
to
 
run
 
your
 
ads.
 
So
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
take
 
that
 
into
 
consideration
 
as
 
well.
 
So
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
you
 
see,
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
look
 
at
 
your
 
numbers
 
religiously,
 
you
 
can
 
lose
 
so
 
much
 
money.
 
Just
 
because
 
you
 
don't
 
understand
 
the
 
numbers.
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
people
 
don't
 
understand.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
communicate
 
also
 
to
 
clients
 
in
 
my
 
school.
 
I
 
understand
 
business.
 
I
 
don't
 
care
 
about
 
Facebook.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
need
 
to,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
understand
 
what's
 
the
 
KPI
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
and
 
what's,
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
actions
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
take
 
in
 
order
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
get
 
there?
 
And
 
that's
 
it.
 
It's
 
very
 
simple.
 
People
 
don't
 
work
 
like
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
I
 
honestly,
 
I
 
thought
 
that
 
because
 
this
 
guy
 
in
 
Texas,
 
like
 
you
 
were
 
really
 
like,
 
they,
 
they
 
really,
 
like,
 
he
 
talked
 
really
 
about
 
how
 
they
 
helped
 
them
 
and
 
everything.
 
39:25
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
maybe
 
they
 
do
 
know,
 
they
 
do
 
know
 
what
 
they're
 
doing.
 
You
 
know?
 
39:29

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
39:29
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
.
 
39:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
But
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
they
 
don't,
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
they
 
just
 
don't.
 
39:35
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do.
 
39:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
at.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
trying
 
to
 
say
 
to
 
tell
 
you,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
simulation
 
because
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
before
 
we
 
start
 
running.
 
Okay.
 
What's
 
the
 
maximum
 
number
 
of
 
profit
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
have?
 
Like,
 
okay.
 
You
 
say,
 
Oriel,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
anywhere
 
off
 
$175
 
a
 
session
 
profit,
 
anything
 
less
 
than
 
that.
 
That's
 
not
 
worth
 
my
 
time.
 
That's
 
completely
 
fine.
 
So
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
optimize.
 
It's
 
based
 
on
 
this
 
number.
 
This
 
is
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
optimize
 
off.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
what
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
we
 
have
 
100
 
leads,
 
20
 
booked,
 
10
 
show
 
up,
 
3
 
closed.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
optimize
 
these
 
numbers
 
too.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
why
 
from
 
100
 
leads,
 
why
 
did
 
only
 
20
 
book?
 
Why
 
not
 
50?
 
Why
 
did
 
only
 
10
 
people
 
show
 
up?
 
Why
 
is
 
it
 
not
 
a
 
70%
 
show
 
up
 
rate,
 
80%
 
show
 
up
 
rate?
 
What
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
increase
 
that?
 
From
 
these
 
people
 
that
 
closed,
 
why
 
could
 
we
 
not
 
get
 
the
 
closing
 
rate
 
higher?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
objections
 
that
 
they
 
have?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
patterns
 
that
 
they're
 
going
 
through?
 
Like,
 
is
 
it
 
the
 
offer?
 
Are
 
they
 
scared?
 
Do
 
they
 
have
 
uncertainty?
 
Like,
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
there?
 
What
 
can
 
we
 
do
 
to
 
improve
 
these
 
numbers
 
and
 
optimize
 
them
 
all
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
get
 
the
 
CPA
 
down?
 
And
 
also
 
on
 
your
 
back
 
end,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
you
 
get
 
your
 
base
 
LTV,
 
which
 
is,
 
you
 
know,
 
1750,
 
and
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
it
 
always
 
grows.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
six
 
sessions
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
do
 
like
 
a
 
maintenance
 
session
 
once
 
a
 
month.
 
And
 
then
 
your
 
LTV
 
keeps
 
on
 
going,
 
which
 
is
 
like,
 
basically,
 
like,
 
uh,
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
mini
 
subscription
 
army
 
of,
 
for
 
example,
 
30
 
people
 
that
 
pay
 
$200
 
a
 
month,
 
you
 
start
 
the
 
month
 
with
 
$6,000
 
in
 
your
 
pocket
 
before
 
you
 
even
 
got
 
your
 
new
 
patients.
 
You
 
see,
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
business.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
right
 
way
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
things.
 
You
 
look
 
at
 
numbers
 
and
 
you
 
see,
 
okay,
 
how
 
do
 
I
 
make
 
each
 
customer
 
more
 
valuable?
 
And
 
how
 
do
 
I
 
get
 
my
 
CPA
 
down?
 
And
 
how
 
do
 
I
 
optimize
 
everything
 
in
 
between
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
I,
 
you
 
know,
 
make
 
money?
 
Because
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
do.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
money
 
and
 
help
 
people.
 
These
 
are
 
the
 
two
 
main
 
purposes
 
here.
 
And
 
we
 
optimize
 
based
 
on
 
these
 
goals.
 
And
 
that's
 
it.
 
So,
 
very
 
simple.
 
I'm
 
pretty
 
sure
 
that
 
if
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
the
 
call
 
with
 
her,
 
she's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
showing
 
up
 
all
 
these
 
numbers
 
and
 
trying
 
to
 
understand
 
them.

Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
what,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
she
 
has
 
to
 
say
 
about
 
why
 
the
 
performance
 
has
 
been
 
so
 
low.
 
And,
 
um,
 
You
 
know,
 
I,
 
I
 
know
 
that,
 
um,
 
the
 
contract
 
is
 
just
 
month
 
to
 
month
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
contract
 
and
 
just
 
see
 
what
 
my
 
cancellation
 
policy
 
is
 
with
 
them.
 
Cause
 
yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
do,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
spend
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
money
 
next
 
month
 
and
 
get
 
nothing
 
because
 
I
 
mean,
 
it's
 
already,
 
it's,
 
things
 
are
 
just,
 
I
 
just,
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
already
 
just
 
barely
 
hanging
 
on.
 
And
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
point
 
where
 
if
 
I'm
 
at
 
least
 
making
 
enough
 
profit,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
hire
 
really
 
sometimes
 
I
 
need
 
to,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
really
 
hire
 
another
 
assistant.
 
So
 
it
 
doesn't
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
my
 
daughter.
 
She's
 
a
 
high
 
school
 
student,
 
but
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
really
 
need
 
an
 
assistant,
 
somebody
 
that
 
really
 
take
 
things
 
off
 
my
 
plate,
 
but
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
need
 
the
 
revenue
 
to,
 
to
 
make,
 
make
 
that
 
jump.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
like,
 
uh,
 
it's
 
like,
 
uh,
 
you
 
know,
 
when,
 
when
 
do
 
you,
 
when
 
do
 
you
 
leap
 
off
 
the
 
cliff
 
that's
 
crumbling
 
beneath
 
You
 
know,
 
leap
 
to
 
another
 
cliff,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
you're
 
hoping
 
will
 
sustain
 
you,
 
you
 
know,
 
so
 
it's
 
just,
 
that's
 
been
 
the
 
only
 
thing.
 
Anyway,
 
I'll
 
just
 
show
 
you
 
right
 
quick
 
this
 
guy.
 
This
 
is
 
who
 
the
 
guy
 
was.
 
I
 
never
 
even
 
got
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
him
 
that
 
I
 
met
 
when
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
the
 
training.

We
 
can
 
look
 
at
 
his
 
ads
 
if
 
you
 
want.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
they're
 
running
 
ads
 
from
 
their
 
page
 
as
 
well
 
for
 
him.
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
his
 
website.
 
They
 
probably
 
did
 
not
 
do
 
his
 
website.
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
that
 
by
 
the,
 
by
 
what
 
I
 
saw,
 
like
 
the
 
impression
 
that
 
I
 
got,
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
they
 
did
 
his
 
website.
 
We
 
can
 
look

So
 
if
 
you
 
scroll

here's
 
a
 
little
 
hack
 
for
 
you.
 
So,
 
scroll
 
down
 
to
 
the
 
bottom

the

Now
 
they're
 
supposed
 
to
 
be...
 
Okay,
 
hack
 
is
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
We
 
don't
 
have
 
his

So
 
scroll
 
up
 
and
 
go
 
open
 
up.
 
No,
 
let

this.

Let's
 
see.
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to...
 
Let
 
me
 
share
 
my
 
screen.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
share
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing
 
as
 
well.
 
So,
 
okay,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
his
 
website.
 
I
 
wonder
 
who
 
built
 
the
 
website.
 
Nobody
 
didn't
 
show
 
who
 
built
 
the
 
website.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
little
 
box.
 
Here,
 
which
 
is
 
cool.
 
I
 
wonder
 
if
 
he
 
has,
 
okay,
 
so
 
another
 
good
 
thing
 
that
 
he
 
has,
 
which
 
is
 
important,
 
he
 
has
 
a
 
blog,
 
which
 
really
 
helps
 
with
 
his
 
SEO.
 
Is,
 
patients
 
do
 
this?
 
Do
 
they
 
do
 
that?
 
Or,
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
should
 
talk
 
to
 
him,
 
honestly.
 
45:21

Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
They
 
didn't
 
do
 
anything
 
with
 
my
 
website.

Oriel

So
 
yeah,
 
ask
 
this
 
guy,
 
talk
 
to
 
him,
 
say,
 
oh,
 
I
 
see
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
blog
 
on
 
your
 
website.
 
Like,
 
who
 
does
 
that
 
blog
 
for
 
you,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Because
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
it
 
helps
 
with
 
SEO,
 
because
 
when
 
people
 
do
 
search
 
up
 
for
 
it,
 
it's
 
gonna
 
help
 
people
 
get
 
to
 
you
 
organically.
 
I
 
specifically,
 
that's
 
a
 
weak
 
point
 
for
 
me.
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
a
 
weak
 
point
 
for
 
me,
 
SEO.
 
I
 
really
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
with
 
the
 
SEO
 
and
 
AI,
 
because
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
SEO
 
with
 
AI,
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
just
 
get
 
insane
 
results
 
and
 
stuff.
 
But
 
I
 
haven't
 
had
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
actually
 
dive
 
into
 
that.
 
Well,
 
that's
 
a
 
lie,
 
I
 
did
 
have
 
the
 
time.
 
It's
 
just
 
not
 
in
 
my
 
priorities.
 
So,
 
I
 
wanna
 
see
 
his
 
ads,
 
and
 
see...
 
If
 
it's
 
from
 
his,
 
it's
 
from
 
his
 
page,
 
or
 
from
 
their
 
page.

That's

him,
 
right?
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
you
 
see,
 
oh
 
my
 
God.
 
This
 
ad
 
though,
 
this
 
ad
 
is
 
unbelievable.
 
I
 
actually
 
had
 
an

for
 
myself
 
that
 
on
 
this
 
ad.
 
Like
 
this
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
ads
 
that
 
I'm
 
running
 
right
 
now.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
him
 
though.
 
don't
 
think,
 
no,
 
that's
 
a

46:58

I

they're

And
 
I'm

it's

Hi,
 
Keith.
 
How
 
are
 
I'm
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
right
 
now.
 
I
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
call
 
you.
 
I
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
call
 
you
 
because
 
I
 
never
 
did
 
get
 
those
 
samples
 
from
 
my
 
new
 
medical
 
office.
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
you
 
could.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
I'll
 
call
 
you
 
back
 
when
 
I
 
get
 
a
 
chance.
 
Hey,
 
when
 
you
 
call
 
me,
 
call
 
me
 
on
 
my
 
cell
 
phone
 
because
 
I
 
always,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
patient
 
number.
 
So
 
when
 
I
 
call
 
you
 
back,
 
I'll
 
call
 
you
 
from
 
my
 
cell
 
phone.
 
So
 
you
 
make
 
sure
 
you
 
just
 
save
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
Thanks,

I'll

you

Thank

Um,
 
I,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
seem

I

I
 
can't
 
find
 
my

though.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
actually
 
show
 
you
 
one
 
ad
 
that
 
we

that
 
we're

So
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
guy,
 
Hope
 
and
 
Melons.
 
All
 
right,
 
you
 
probably
 
cannot
 
hear
 
the
 
audio.
 
So,
 
all
 
right,
 
let
 
redo
 
this.

Okay,
 
cool.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
ad,
 
again,
 
it's
 
a
 
video
 
ad,
 
extremely
 
long,
 
but
 
it
 
works,
 
like
 
the
 
click-through
 
rate
 
on
 
that
 
is
 
very,
 
very
 
high.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
this,
 
basically,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
hook,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you.
 
Is
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression
 
actually
 
untreatable?
 
A
 
new
 
ground-breaking,
 
pill-free
 
treatment
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
studied
 
in
 
over
 
400
 
clinical
 
studies
 
is
 
proving
 
otherwise.
 
If
 
you've
 
been
 
struggling,
 
this
 
may
 
be
 
the
 
solution
 
for
 
you.
 
Across
 
the
 
country,
 
millions
 
of
 
people
 
are
 
quietly
 
doing
 
everything
 
right
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
treating
 
the
 
depression.
 
They're
 
showing
 
therapy,
 
they're
 
taking
 
medications,
 
they're
 
practicing
 
gratitude,
 
trying
 
to
 
stay
 
positive.
 
But
 
still,
 
the
 
heaviness
 
stays.
 
It's
 
like
 
a
 
thought
 
that
 
will
 
never
 
lift.
 
And
 
the
 
system
 
keeps
 
saying,
 
keep
 
going,
 
adjust
 
the
 
dose,
 
wait
 
it
 
out.
 
But
 
if
 
you've
 
ever
 
done
 
everything
 
right
 
and
 
still
 
feel
 
stuck,
 
you
 
know
 
how
 
painful
 
it
 
is
 
to
 
wonder
 
if
 
healing
 
is
 
impossible
 
for
 
you.
 
Let
 
me
 
say
 
this
 
clearly,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
you
 
did
 
not
 
try
 
hard
 
enough,
 
it's
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
gave
 
you
 
the
 
wrong
 
tools.
 
51:53
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
Traditional
 
psychiatry
 
was
 
built
 
to
 
manage
 
symptoms,
 
not
 
to
 
resolve
 
them.
 
And
 
just,
 
add
 
a
 
myth.
 
Can't
 
sleep,
 
add
 
another.
 
Still
 
stuck,
 
increase
 
the
 
dose.
 
But
 
that's
 
like
 
turning
 
down
 
the
 
volume
 
on
 
a
 
smoke
 
alarm,
 
while
 
the
 
fire
 
alarm
 
or
 
the
 
fire
 
still
 
burns.
 
And
 
when
 
the
 
alarm
 
finally
 
goes
 
silent,
 
the
 
damage
 
continues.
 
It's
 
quiet,
 
it's
 
dangerous.
 
So
 
what's
 
the
 
alternative?
 
Stop
 
muting
 
the
 
signal
 
and
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
root.
 
Thanks
 
to
 
breakthroughs
 
in
 
neuroscience,
 
there
 
is
 
now
 
an
 
FDA-approved
 
treatment
 
that
 
targets
 
depression
 
at
 
its
 
core.
 
It's
 
called
 
Spravato,
 
a
 
nasal
 
spray
 
designed
 
for
 
people
 
who
 
haven't
 
responded
 
to
 
traditional
 
medications.
 
It's
 
not
 
just
 
another
 
pill.
 
It
 
works
 
differently,
 
and
 
for
 
many
 
people,
 
it
 
works
 
faster.
 
Spravato
 
targets
 
a
 
different
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
brain,
 
the
 
NMPA
 
receptors,
 
which
 
responsible
 
for
 
thought
 
loops,
 
negative
 
biases,
 
and
 
emotional
 
notes.
 
Unlike
 
SSRIs
 
that
 
can
 
take
 
months
 
to
 
start
 
working,
 
Spravato
 
can
 
start
 
working
 
with
 
hours
 
to
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
it.

So,
 
basically,
 
you
 
see,
 
this
 
is
 
an
 
educational
 
ad
 
to
 
the
 
max.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
educate
 
your
 
patients,
 
tell
 
them,
 
okay,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
you've
 
been
 
through,
 
we
 
understand.
 
Another
 
pill
 
is
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
solve
 
it,
 
but
 
there
 
is
 
something
 
else.
 
Here's
 
why
 
this
 
something
 
else
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
help
 
you.
 
Okay?
 
And
 
we
 
also
 
have
 
this
 
ad,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
very,
 
very
 
long
 
ad,
 
just
 
talking
 
about
 
the,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
pains
 
and
 
everything.
 
And
 
there's
 
also
 
this
 
guy
 
that
 
I
 
told
 
you
 
about,
 
Alpha
 
Omega
 
Illness,
 
which
 
is,
 
this
 
guy's
 
insane

his

No.
 
But
 
I
 
would
 
definitely,
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
he
 
does
 
it,
 
I

do
 
it
 
that
 
way.

a
 
payment
 
thing?
 
54:21
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
It's
 
Klarna.
 
Maybe
 
it's
 
Clara,
 
K-L-A-R-A.
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
talking
 
about.
 
They
 
look
 
alike.
 
One's
 
a
 
phone
 
service
 
that
 
one
 
of
 
my
 
doctors
 
uses
 
to
 
send
 
texts
 
and
 
stuff
 
like
 
that
 
and
 
to
 
communicate
 
and
 
to
 
answer
 
phone
 
calls.
 
I
 
have
 
one
 
call
 
with
 
them
 
today
 
just
 
because
 
I
 
am
 
looking
 
for
 
some
 
type
 
of
 
phone
 
solution.
 
That's
 
an
 
ongoing
 
challenge.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
We
 
have
 
that
 
solution,
 
though.
 
HighLevel
 
has
 
everything.
 
You
 
just
 
need
 
the
 
app.
 
We
 
already,
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
I
 
didn't
 
delete
 
your
 
account.
 
Your
 
account
 
is
 
still
 
live
 
with
 
me
 
because
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
feeling
 
that
 
it
 
would
 
not,
 
it
 
wouldn't.
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
feeling
 
that
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
OK,
 
let's
 
let
 
her
 
start.
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
account,
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
We
 
already
 
have
 
a
 
number
 
there.
 
You
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
download
 
the
 
app
 
and
 
start
 
calling.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
record
 
the
 
calls.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
everything
 
in
 
the
 
app,
 
the
 
transcripts,
 
whatever
 
you
 
want.
 
It's
 
very
 
simple.
 
You
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
for
 
outside
 
solutions.
 
There's
 
everything
 
in
 
just
 
one
 
place.
 
You
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
utilize
 
the
 
tools
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
way.
 
The
 
tools
 
are
 
there.
 
Thank
 
God,
 
2025,
 
unbelievable
 
technology.
 
So
 
it's
 
becoming
 
more
 
and
 
more
 
insane,
 
actually.
 
So
 
there's
 
everything
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
is
 
already
 
here.
 
You
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
leverage
 
the
 
tools
 
that
 
are
 
at
 
your
 
hand,
 
which
 
that
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
done
 
up
 
until
 
now.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
as
 
simple
 
as
 
that.
 
55:45
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
have
 
everything's
 
going
 
well
 
with
 
the.
 
The
 
next
 
step
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
really
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
expand
 
is
 
to
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
place
 
where
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
more
 
than
 
the
 
three
 
patients.
 
So
 
now
 
the
 
office
 
space
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
can
 
only
 
accommodate
 
three
 
people.
 
1,
 
to
 
Thank
 
At
 
a
 
time.
 
And
 
what
 
I'm
 
hoping
 
is
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
everything
 
starts
 
growing
 
together.
 
So
 
if
 
I,
 
you
 
know,
 
get
 
a
 
system
 
in
 
place
 
where
 
I'm
 
getting
 
more
 
leads,
 
have
 
more
 
people,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
space
 
to
 
accommodate
 
the
 
sessions
 
too.
 
And
 
I
 
also
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
some
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
billing
 
and
 
the
 
billing
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
and
 
stuff
 
like
 
that.
 
So
 
I've
 
been
 
working
 
on
 
getting
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
stuff
 
taken
 
care
 
of
 
because
 
now,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
I
 
explained
 
it
 
to
 
you,
 
but
 
I
 
currently
 
use
 
like
 
Growth
 
Therapy
 
and
 
Alma
 
for,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
these
 
platforms.
 
56:46

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What
 
did
 
they
 
do?
 
56:47
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
What's
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
that?
 
So
 
Growth
 
Therapy,
 
Alma,
 
and
 
Headway,
 
they're
 
three
 
platforms.
 
And
 
what
 
they
 
do
 
is
 
they
 
court
 
individual
 
providers
 
and
 
they
 
say,
 
hey,
 
come
 
to
 
us,
 
let
 
us
 
credential
 
you.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
credentialing
 
is,
 
right?
 
57:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
For
 
healthcare
 
providers.
 
57:03
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
So
 
credentialing
 
is
 
the
 
process
 
of,
 
say
 
if
 
you're
 
Blue
 
Cross
 
Blue
 
Shield,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
major
 
insurance
 
company,
 
right?
 
You
 
are
 
Blue
 
Cross
 
Blue
 
Shield.
 
I
 
am
 
Dr.
 
Williams.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
see
 
Blue
 
Cross
 
Blue
 
Shield
 
patients.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
you.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
lay
 
out
 
all
 
my
 
credentials,
 
my
 
training,
 
this
 
and
 
that.
 
And
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
run
 
a
 
check
 
basically
 
and
 
say,
 
okay,
 
you're
 
verified.
 
You're
 
in
 
network.
 
Now
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
my
 
patients
 
that
 
have
 
a
 
Blue
 
Cross
 
Blue
 
Shield
 
policy.
 
So
 
that
 
process
 
for
 
healthcare
 
providers
 
is
 
called
 
credentialing.
 
So
 
what
 
Alma,
 
Headway,
 
and
 
Growth
 
Therapy
 
do
 
is
 
they
 
credential
 
you,
 
the
 
individual
 
provider,
 
under
 
their
 
umbrella,
 
right?
 
And
 
then
 
they
 
do
 
the
 
billing
 
for
 
you.
 
But
 
then
 
with
 
each
 
credentialed
 
contract,
 
there's
 
a
 
certain
 
amount
 
of
 
codes
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
use.
 
So
 
if
 
I,
 
if
 
you're
 
my
 
patient
 
and
 
I
 
prescribe
 
a
 
medication,
 
that's
 
one
 
code.
 
So
 
if
 
I
 
give
 
If
 
you
 
therapy
 
and
 
like,
 
just
 
say,
 
if
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
the
 
passing
 
of
 
your
 
dad
 
and
 
I
 
gave
 
you
 
some
 
tools
 
to
 
manage
 
the
 
grief,
 
that's
 
therapy,
 
right?
 
And
 
that's
 
a
 
different
 
code
 
I
 
would
 
use
 
to
 
show
 
the
 
insurance
 
company
 
what
 
I
 
have
 
done
 
to
 
help
 
you,
 
right?
 
So
 
growth
 
therapy
 
and
 
Alma
 
and
 
Headway,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
limitation
 
on
 
the
 
codes
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
use.
 
And
 
it
 
requires
 
me
 
with
 
each
 
person
 
to
 
do
 
therapy.
 
That's
 
not
 
a
 
bad
 
thing,
 
but
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
limiting
 
thing
 
because
 
I
 
can't
 
do
 
therapy
 
with
 
10
 
people
 
at
 
once.
 
So
 
each
 
person,
 
I'm
 
limited
 
in
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
at
 
one
 
time.
 
But
 
if
 
I
 
had
 
other
 
codes
 
available
 
to
 
me,
 
I
 
can
 
basically
 
put
 
everybody
 
in
 
a
 
room,
 
give
 
everybody
 
their
 
Spravato,
 
and
 
just
 
basically
 
make
 
the
 
focus
 
be
 
not
 
the
 
therapy
 
piece,
 
but
 
monitoring
 
their
 
vital
 
signs
 
and
 
monitoring
 
them
 
during...
 
And
 
so
 
those
 
codes
 
are
 
not
 
currently
 
available
 
to
 
me,
 
which
 
keeps
 
me
 
from
 
expanding.
 
So
 
that
 
is
 
a
 
really
 
big
 
part
 
of
 
me
 
expanding
 
is
 
getting
 
the
 
contracts
 
under
 
my
 
own
 
name,
 
under
 
Nirvana
 
Mental
 
Health
 
Care.
 
And
 
so
 
I
 
have
 
those
 
other
 
codes
 
so
 
that
 
everybody
 
comes
 
in,
 
they
 
do
 
their
 
Spravato,
 
they
 
put
 
their
 
headphones
 
on,
 
they
 
listen
 
to
 
their
 
Zen
 
music.
 
And
 
it's
 
not
 
about
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
in
 
there
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
talk
 
to
 
them
 
about
 
their
 
specific
 
issues,
 
because
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
imagine,
 
you
 
have
 
to,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
get,
 
in
 
order
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
decent
 
reimbursement
 
now,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
55
 
minutes
 
of
 
one
 
to
 
one
 
therapy
 
with
 
each
 
person.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
how
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
cumbersome.
 
But
 
those
 
are
 
the
 
only
 
codes
 
that
 
I
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
now.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
credentialing
 
company
 
getting
 
me
 
credential
 
with
 
eight
 
or
 
nine.
 
Kind
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
insurance
 
panels,
 
Blue
 
Cross
 
Blue
 
Shield
 
and
 
Medicaid
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
then
 
everybody
 
can
 
just
 
come
 
in.
 
I
 
document
 
they
 
came
 
in.
 
I
 
took
 
vitals.
 
They
 
sat
 
in
 
the
 
chair.
 
I
 
watched
 
them.
 
These
 
are
 
the
 
vitals.
 
And
 
boom,
 
that's
 
it.
 
And
 
it'll
 
be
 
much
 
easier,
 
much
 
less
 
documentation,
 
and
 
it'll
 
just
 
be
 
better.
 
So
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
working
 
on
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
expand.
 
But
 
then
 
getting
 
the
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
door
 
is
 
obviously
 
that's
 
a
 
different
 
puzzle.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
you
 
need
 
both
 
things
 
to
 
come
 
together.
 
I
 
need
 
the
 
people
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
the
 
door,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
need
 
a
 
place
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
sit
 
when
 
they
 
get
 
in
 
the
 
door.
 
That's
 
bigger
 
than
 
the
 
space
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
now,
 
which
 
is
 
good.
 
It's
 
a
 
good
 
start.
 
But
 
if
 
things
 
take
 
off,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
grow
 
out
 
of
 
it.

Williams,
 
DNP
 
So
 
your
 
baseline,
 
just
 
to
 
return
 
send,
 
you
 
were
 
supposed
 
to
 
get
 
better
 
results
 
by
 
now,
 
at
 
least.
 
Do
 
you
 
mind
 
me?
 
Do
 
me
 
a
 
favor
 
and
 
just
 
texting
 
me
 
these
 
talking
 
points
 
so
 
that
 
during
 
the
 
meeting
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
her
 
and
 
then
 
they'll
 
do
 
that
 
for
 
me.
 
then
 
once
 
I
 
talked
 
to
 
her,
 
I
 
told
 
her
 
2.30
 
today
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
text
 
you
 
and
 
I'll
 
let
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
outcome
 
was.
 
But
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
do
 
something
 
different,
 
Oriel.
 
Like
 
I
 
said,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
had,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
we
 
had
 
a
 
good
 
baseline,
 
good
 
off
 
to
 
start.
 
You
 
were
 
transparent
 
and
 
upfront
 
with
 
me
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
with
 
you.
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
why
 
we're
 
back
 
here
 
talking
 
now.
 
You
 
know,
 
we've
 
been,
 
we've
 
kept
 
it,
 
we've
 
kept
 
it,
 
kept
 
it
 
real
 
with
 
each
 
other.
 
1:02:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
That's
 
what's
 
important.
 
I
 
know
 
that's
 
like,
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
that's
 
my,
 
that's
 
the
 
values
 
that
 
are
 
driving
 
me.
 
And
 
then
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
even
 
if
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
take,
 
you
 
see
 
what
 
it's
 
been
 
like,
 
what,
 
two
 
months
 
since
 
we
 
talked,
 
time
 
does
 
not
 
matter.
 
Okay.
 
Because
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
long
 
game
 
here.
 
There's
 
a
 
very
 
long
 
game.
 
1:02:56
 
-
 
Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
the
 
long
 
game
 
too.
 
And
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
want,
 
I
 
want
 
this,
 
I
 
want
 
my
 
business
 
to
 
grow.
 
Like
 
I
 
really
 
need.
 
My
 
business
 
to
 
grow
 
like
 
it's,
 
I
 
can't
 
stay
 
like
 
this
 
little
 
hamster
 
just
 
making
 
enough
 
to
 
pay
 
everything
 
and
 
barely,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
just,
 
it's
 
just
 
been
 
like
 
that
 
for
 
a
 
long
 
time,
 
in
 
part,
 
not
 
to
 
give
 
a
 
sob
 
story,
 
but
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
a,
 
I'm
 
a,
 
I'm
 
a
 
single
 
parent,
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
children,
 
my,
 
my
 
son
 
is
 
now
 
20.
 
He
 
just
 
left
 
the
 
home
 
six
 
months
 
ago,
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
17
 
year
 
old
 
who's
 
leaving.
 
And
 
as
 
a
 
single
 
parent,
 
my
 
focus
 
has
 
just
 
been
 
pay
 
the
 
bills,
 
make
 
sure
 
I'm
 
feeding
 
my
 
kids,
 
have
 
enough
 
money
 
to
 
send
 
in
 
the
 
camp,
 
put
 
clothes
 
on
 
there,
 
like
 
just,
 
but
 
it's
 
never
 
in
 
10
 
years,
 
it's
 
never
 
been
 
focused
 
on
 
my
 
business.
 
And
 
now
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
adults,
 
young
 
adults,
 
mean,
 
they
 
still
 
need
 
my
 
help.
 
Obviously,
 
she's
 
calling
 
me
 
asking
 
me
 
for
 
$9.
 
So
 
she
 
can
 
get
 
on
 
the
 
bus.
 
But
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
still
 
a
 
mom,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
sit
 
here
 
and
 
freaking
 
breastfeed.
 
And
 
you
 
know,
 
they're
 
young
 
adults.
 
I
 
mean,
 
you're
 
a
 
young
 
adult,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
transition.
 
So
 
they,
 
they
 
need.
 
I
 
things,
 
but
 
what
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
my
 
business
 
so
 
my
 
business
 
can
 
grow
 
so
 
that
 
I
 
can,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
get
 
this
 
thing
 
off
 
the
 
ground.
 
I've
 
been
 
practicing
 
for
 
almost
 
10
 
years.
 
It'll
 
be
 
10
 
years
 
next
 
March.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
time.
 
1:04:21

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It
 
is
 
time.
 
Yeah.
 
1:04:24

Dr.
 
Ayanna
 
Williams,
 
DNP
 
All
 
right.
 
So

me
 
those
 
talking
 
points,
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
text
 
you
 
after
 
I

How's
 
going?
 
Can
 
you
 
hear
 
me?

Amir
 
This
 
meeting
 
is
 
being

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Hey,
 
how's
 
it
 
going?
 
 
@0:07
 
-
 
Amir
 
Not
 
bad.
 
How
 
are
 
you?
 
 
@0:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Great.
 
Actually,
 
no,
 
not
 
very
 
great.
 
Me
 
and
 
my
 
girlfriend
 
broke
 
up.
 
 
@0:14
 
-
 
Amir
 
Oh,
 
really?
 
 
@0:15
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
sorry.
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
not
 
easy,
 
but
 
we
 
do
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
do.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@0:24
 
-
 
Amir
 
All
 
right.
 
So,
 
did
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
read
 
my
 
email,
 
Oriel?
 
 
@0:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes,
 
I
 
did.
 
I
 
also
 
sent
 
you
 
a
 
message,
 
because
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
it
 
now,
 
or
 
I
 
could
 
have
 
also
 
responded
 
to
 
it,
 
but
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
more
 
efficient
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
it
 
now.
 
 
@0:39
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah,
 
let's
 
go
 
over
 
it
 
now.
 
 
@0:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
projects,
 
that's
 
the
 
first
 
thing.
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
open
 
with
 
that,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
touch
 
about
 
anything
 
else
 
in
 
the
 
email?
 
Because
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
what
 
happened
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
agencies
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
Like,
 
you
 
talked
 
about
 
this
 
with
 
me.
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
touch
 
on
 
it?
 
 
@0:56
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yes,
 
we
 
are
 
correct.
 
 
@0:58
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
So,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
The
 
project,
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
the
 
video
 
of
 
me
 
going
 
through
 
the
 
ads
 
of
 
my
 
clients.
 
 
@1:04
 
-
 
Amir
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you've
 
had
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
see
 
it.
 
Did
 
you
 
that
 
to
 
me?
 
 
@1:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
actually
 
sent
 
it
 
to
 
you
 
via
 
SMS.
 
 
@1:12
 
-
 
Amir
 
Oh,
 
really?
 
 
@1:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
 
@1:15
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
it's
 
like
 
a
 
10-minute
 
video
 
of
 
me
 
going
 
all
 
over
 
my
 
clients.
 
Yeah,
 
going
 
all
 
over
 
my
 
clients'
 
results
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I'll
 
go
 
over
 
it.
 
 
@1:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
there
 
are
 
all
 
the
 
stats,
 
the
 
budgets
 
that
 
I'm
 
running,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
main
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
working
 
on
 
right
 
now.
 
Obviously
 
developing
 
the
 
marketing
 
agency
 
in
 
this
 
space
 
in
 
the
 
US.
 
And
 
I
 
have
 
another
 
side
 
project,
 
which
 
is
 
my
 
hobby,
 
which
 
is
 
music.
 
So
 
it
 
doesn't
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
anything.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
working
 
on
 
music.
 
 
@1:43
 
-
 
Amir
 
I'm
 
producing
 
music
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Oriel,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
US
 
clients,
 
any
 
neuromodulation
 
clients
 
in
 
the
 
US?
 
 
@1:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes,
 
I
 
have
 
Greenbrook
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
another
 
guy
 
called
 
Shanz
 
from
 
Hope
 
and
 
Wellness.
 
And
 
another
 
acupuncture
 
clinic,
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
everything's
 
in
 
the
 
video.
 
can
 
see
 
the
 
video
 
itself.
 
 
@1:57
 
-
 
Amir
 
Got
 
it,
 
but
 
I'm...
 
I'm...
 
I
 
was
 
under
 
the
 
impression
 
that
 
Greenbrook's
 
does
 
everything
 
marketing
 
in-house.
 
 
@2:04
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
for
 
them.
 
So
 
I'm
 
writing
 
the
 
ads
 
now
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
people
 
that
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
the,
 
you
 
know,
 
technical
 
stuff
 
of
 
uploading
 
the
 
campaigns
 
and
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
I
 
got
 
into
 
the
 
creative
 
side
 
of
 
things,
 
so.
 
 
@2:16
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
see.
 
 
@2:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
see
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
 
@2:18
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
see
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
So
 
then
 
how
 
is
 
that
 
going
 
to
 
work?
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to,
 
if
 
me
 
and
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
together,
 
then
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
conflict
 
of
 
interest.
 
 
@2:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
I
 
agree
 
with
 
you.
 
This
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
now,
 
but
 
Greenbrook
 
is
 
a
 
consulting
 
client
 
of
 
mine.
 
It
 
does
 
not
 
interfere
 
with
 
my
 
agency.
 
I
 
talked
 
with
 
them
 
about
 
it
 
as
 
well.
 
They
 
have
 
no
 
problem
 
with
 
me
 
doing
 
whatever
 
I'm
 
doing.
 
Obviously
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
conflict
 
of
 
interest,
 
but
 
it's
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
take
 
and
 
work
 
with
 
because
 
I
 
cannot
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
they're
 
a
 
big
 
client.
 
They
 
can
 
help
 
me
 
a
 
lot
 
in
 
my
 
reputation
 
as
 
well.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
completely
 
honest
 
with
 
you.
 
And
 
I'm
 
just
 
working.
 
I'm
 
just,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
just
 
working
 
with
 
it.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
have,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
anything
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
bring
 
up
 
and
 
talk
 
about,
 
of
 
course,
 
you
 
can
 
freely
 
do
 
so.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
with
 
that,
 
that's
 
completely
 
fine
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@3:08
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
so,
 
yes,
 
so
 
that's,
 
so
 
there
 
are
 
three
 
Greenbrook
 
offices
 
close
 
to
 
my
 
office,
 
like,
 
they're
 
my
 
biggest
 
competitor.
 
And,
 
and
 
obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
I
 
mean,
 
if,
 
if
 
me
 
and
 
you,
 
me
 
and
 
you
 
work
 
on
 
the
 
level
 
that
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
about,
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
talking
 
about
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
ideas.
 
And
 
then,
 
okay,
 
so
 
clearly,
 
like,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
so
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
creative
 
mind,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
coming
 
up
 
with
 
something,
 
but
 
there's
 
a
 
limited
 
amount
 
of,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
creating
 
something,
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
doing
 
an
 
ad
 
right
 
before
 
this.
 
I
 
mean,
 
there's
 
a
 
limited
 
amount
 
of
 
things
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
come
 
up
 
with.
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's,
 
like,
 
there's
 
a
 
limited
 
amount
 
of
 
wording,
 
there's
 
a
 
limited
 
amount
 
of
 
artwork.
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
creative,
 
but,
 
but
 
there's,
 
there's
 
this
 
bucket.
 
And
 
then.
 
You
 
can
 
easily,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
go
 
from,
 
you
 
know,
 
okay,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
I'm
 
creating
 
this
 
for
 
Greenbrook's,
 
and
 
then
 
now
 
I'm
 
creating
 
this
 
for
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
agencies,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
somewhere
 
else.
 
Majority
 
of
 
the
 
ideas
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
for
 
this
 
practice,
 
for
 
this
 
company,
 
for
 
the
 
marketing
 
company,
 
are
 
basically
 
what
 
I'm
 
using
 
in
 
my
 
own
 
marketing
 
initiatives.
 
And
 
then,
 
so
 
I
 
cannot
 
disclose
 
that
 
to
 
you,
 
because
 
then
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
biggest
 
competitor
 
of
 
me.

100%.
 
So,
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
say
 
about
 
that
 
is
 
that
 
Greenbrook
 
wants
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
specific
 
areas
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
okay?
 
That's
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
what
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
focusing
 
on
 
in
 
Q4,
 
and
 
they're
 
running
 
ads
 
across
 
the
 
entire
 
U.S.,
 
so
 
it's
 
not
 
specifically
 
in
 
local
 
areas
 
such
 
as
 
yours.
 
Another
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
that
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
understand
 
is,
 
you
 
talked
 
about
 
the
 
creative
 
and
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
awarding
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
What
 
I
 
like
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
my
 
ads
 
is
 
to
 
create
 
clinics.
 
How
 
do
 
even
 
say
 
that?
 
Clinic
 
unique
 
ads,
 
I
 
guess
 
you
 
could
 
say.
 
what
 
are
 
these
 
clinic-specific
 
ads?
 
And
 
how
 
can
 
you
 
create
 
clinic-specific
 
ads?
 
Mostly
 
from
 
testimonials.
 
So
 
testimonials
 
ads
 
are
 
not
 
just
 
people
 
filming
 
and
 
say,
 
oh,
 
I
 
feel
 
better.
 
It's
 
basically
 
the
 
clinic
 
owner
 
itself
 
talking
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
the
 
camera
 
about
 
a
 
story
 
of
 
a
 
patient.
 
And
 
then
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
there's
 
a
 
testimonial
 
or
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
testimonials.
 
And
 
that's
 
an
 
ad
 
that
 
nobody
 
can
 
steal
 
because,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
it's
 
unethical.
 
Second
 
of
 
all,
 
it's
 
basically
 
illegal.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
do.
 
I
 
don't
 
create.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
specific
 
copywriting
 
and
 
specific
 
ads
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
use
 
across
 
clinics.
 
But
 
even
 
then,
 
I
 
change
 
things
 
up
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
change
 
the
 
concept
 
so
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
word-to-word.
 
Specifically,
 
I
 
do
 
have
 
an
 
exclusivity
 
contract,
 
though,
 
with
 
clients.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
always
 
push
 
the
 
clinic
 
owner
 
itself
 
to
 
be
 
on
 
camera
 
and
 
talk.
 
So
 
it's
 
impossible
 
to
 
steal
 
the
 
And
 
that's
 
the
 
problem
 
with
 
static
 
images.
 
You
 
can
 
always
 
steal
 
these
 
images.
 
But
 
when
 
the
 
clinic
 
owner
 
is
 
talking
 
with
 
your
 
ads,
 
as
 
I've
 
seen,
 
it's
 
impossible
 
to
 
steal
 
them.
 
 
@6:11
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
absolutely
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
But
 
still,
 
that's
 
a
 
huge
 
issue.
 
I'm
 
not
 
willing
 
to
 
jeopardize
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
ideas
 
that
 
we
 
have.
 
 
@6:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Because
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
very
 
different.
 
 
@6:26
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
think
 
our
 
product
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
unique.
 
And
 
I
 
cannot
 
jeopardize
 
this
 
for
 
somebody
 
who
 
is
 
also
 
doing
 
marketing
 
on
 
the
 
site
 
to
 
just
 
be
 
involved
 
in
 
that.
 
That's
 
one
 
thing.
 
And
 
then
 
the
 
other
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
was
 
mentioning
 
in
 
the
 
email
 
is
 
that,
 
so
 
again,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
who
 
you
 
are.
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
is
 
your
 
market
 
space
 
or
 
how
 
much
 
is
 
your
 
financials
 
or
 
revenue
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
But
 
whatever
 
it
 
is,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
am
 
looking
 
for
 
something.
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
be
 
100%
 
invested
 
in
 
this
 
company
 
and
 
not
 
anything
 
else
 
because,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
doing
 
it
 
and
 
I'm
 
a
 
person
 
who
 
works
 
16
 
to
 
18
 
hours
 
a
 
day.
 
I
 
think
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I,
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
six
 
months,
 
I've
 
worked
 
every
 
day
 
for
 
16
 
to
 
18
 
hours,
 
although
 
I
 
was
 
doing
 
clinical
 
stuff,
 
but
 
I
 
think
 
on
 
average
 
I
 
spend
 
10
 
hours
 
a
 
day
 
on
 
marketing.
 
And,
 
and
 
that's
 
something
 
that
 
requires
 
dedication.
 
It
 
cannot
 
be
 
done
 
with
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
okay,
 
I'm
 
running
 
one
 
company
 
and
 
then
 
I'm
 
running
 
another
 
company.
 
And
 
then
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
doesn't
 
work
 
because
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent
 
involved
 
or
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
involved.
 
And
 
then
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
overseeing.
 
Because
 
again,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I,
 
you
 
know,
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
marketing
 
idea,
 
I
 
have
 
other
 
ideas.
 
Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
expand
 
my
 
business.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
open
 
another
 
practice
 
and
 
you
 
know,
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
all
 
of
 
this.
 
So
 
I
 
like,
 
I
 
want,
 
I
 
want
 
somebody
 
that
 
I
 
can,
 
as
 
I
 
told
 
you
 
last
 
time
 
to
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
create
 
this
 
and
 
then
 
offload
 
it
 
completely
 
to,
 
to
 
another
 
person
 
who
 
can
 
run
 
this.
 
And
 
so
 
that
 
is
 
who
 
I'm
 
looking
 
for.
 
And
 
the
 
reason,
 
again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
interviewed
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
people
 
who
 
are,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
very,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
advanced
 
in
 
marketing.
 
But
 
the
 
problem
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
people
 
who
 
know
 
marketing
 
is
 
that
 
they
 
don't
 
know
 
neuromodulation.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
teach
 
them
 
neuromodulation.
 
And
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
time.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
in
 
your
 
particular
 
case,
 
it
 
was
 
different.
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
you
 
are
 
an
 
individual
 
who
 
knows
 
neuromodulation.
 
So
 
is
 
that
 
something
 
that,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
potentially
 
would
 
be
 
viable
 
to
 
you
 
or
 
no?
 
You're
 
not
 
looking
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
focus
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
you're
 
not
 
willing
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
let
 
go
 
and
 
then
 
focus
 
on
 
one
 
thing.
 
Again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
trusting
 
somebody
 
who
 
you
 
never
 
met.
 
 
@8:42

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
second
 
time
 
that
 
you
 
were
 
meeting.
 
And
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
go
 
with
 
that.
 
So
 
I'll
 
tell
 
you
 
my
 
goal.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
I
 
also
 
can
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
dashboard
 
and
 
everything
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
because
 
I
 
created
 
this
 
very
 
nice
 
dashboard
 
with
 
Base44,
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
that
 
is.
 
About
 
my
 
goals
 
and
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do.
 
Okay.
 
My
 
goal
 
is
 
very,
 
very
 
simple.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
hit
 
a
 
certain
 
revenue
 
goal
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
next
 
year.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
$75,000
 
a
 
month.
 
That's
 
my
 
goal.
 
It's
 
possible.
 
I've
 
done
 
my
 
research.
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I
 
did
 
the
 
numbers.
 
It's
 
possible.
 
The
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
it
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
to
 
me.
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
work
 
ethic.
 
The
 
question
 
is,
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
our
 
dynamic?
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
our
 
dynamic.
 
What's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
your
 
involvement
 
in
 
this
 
whole
 
process.
 
And
 
also,
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
expect
 
us
 
to
 
work
 
together?
 
Because
 
to
 
me,
 
in
 
my
 
eyes,
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
understand,
 
it's
 
us
 
partnering
 
up.
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
person.
 
In
 
my
 
identity,
 
the
 
identity
 
of
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
works
 
for
 
someone
 
has
 
died
 
a
 
long
 
time
 
ago.
 
So,
 
if
 
the
 
dynamic
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
giving
 
me
 
orders
 
or
 
telling
 
me
 
what
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
and
 
not
 
giving
 
me
 
strategic,
 
strategic,
 
I
 
didn't
 
even
 
say
 
that
 
word,
 
strategic.
 
Strategic,
 
you
 
know,
 
thinking
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
control
 
over
 
things
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
problem
 
because
 
I
 
sensed
 
and
 
I
 
did
 
some
 
research
 
on
 
you.
 
And
 
I
 
analyzed
 
our
 
last
 
call
 
and
 
everything.
 
And
 
you're
 
a
 
go
 
getter.
 
I'm
 
also
 
a
 
go
 
getter.
 
This
 
can
 
collide.
 
Okay,
 
we're
 
both,
 
we're
 
both
 
dominant
 
individuals.
 
Okay,
 
I'm
 
aware
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
me
 
yet.
 
So
 
you
 
don't
 
really
 
know
 
that.
 
And
 
I'm
 
so
 
it's
 
important
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
disclose
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
Whether,
 
whether
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
happening
 
100%.
 
You
 
have,
 
you
 
definitely
 
did
 
an
 
excellent
 
job.
 
And
 
by
 
that
 
email
 
that
 
you
 
send
 
and
 
all
 
these
 
tools
 
that
 
you
 
asked
 
me
 
about,
 
it
 
shows
 
that
 
you
 
actually
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
talking
 
about.
 
Because
 
yeah,
 
these
 
are
 
tools
 
that
 
not
 
everybody
 
knows
 
about.
 
And
 
yes,
 
I'm
 
familiar
 
with
 
80%
 
of
 
these
 
tools.
 
There's
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
them
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
but
 
don't
 
use
 
because
 
there's
 
no
 
need
 
of
 
them
 
for
 
them.
 
And
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
them
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
know
 
on
 
like,
 
completely
 
honest
 
with
 
you.
 
So,
 
yes.
 
I
 
can
 
be
 
invested
 
in
 
this
 
100%.
 
It
 
just
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
dynamic.
 
What's
 
the
 
product
 
that
 
we
 
offer?
 
How
 
does
 
our
 
structure
 
look
 
like?
 
And
 
it's
 
basically
 
that.
 
And
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
is
 
expected
 
of
 
me
 
so
 
I
 
know
 
exactly
 
what
 
I'm
 
going
 
inside
 
to
 
because
 
if
 
our
 
goal,
 
if
 
you
 
say
 
on
 
my
 
list,
 
Oriel,
 
our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
partner
 
up.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
this.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
pitch.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
MVP,
 
minimum
 
viable
 
product,
 
to
 
sell
 
to
 
people,
 
see
 
how
 
it
 
goes.
 
Then
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
sell
 
it
 
to
 
five
 
clinics,
 
see
 
how
 
it
 
works.
 
Okay.
 
We
 
see
 
that
 
there's
 
something
 
going
 
on.
 
It's
 
working.
 
Okay.
 
Let's
 
hire
 
people.
 
Start
 
transferring
 
skills.
 
Then
 
that
 
sounds
 
like
 
something
 
I
 
would
 
do
 
because
 
in
 
my
 
eyes,
 
I'll
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
you,
 
you
 
have
 
leverage
 
for
 
me.
 
You
 
have
 
leverage
 
for
 
me
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
expertise
 
and
 
the
 
knowledge
 
and
 
also
 
the
 
values
 
that
 
I'm
 
looking
 
for.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
the
 
path
 
to
 
me
 
doesn't
 
matter.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
what
 
I'm
 
looking
 
for.
 
And
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
a
 
specific
 
set
 
of
 
clinics,
 
make
 
a
 
certain
 
amount
 
of
 
money.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
change
 
the
 
world
 
in
 
1%.
 
That's
 
my
 
goal.
 
Change
 
the
 
world
 
in
 
1%
 
because
 
that's
 
what
 
you
 
guys
 
do.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
call
 
as
 
well.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
hope
 
this
 
is
 
a,
 
is
 
this
 
clear?
 
Is
 
this
 
a,
 
is
 
this?
 
 
@12:14
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
very
 
clear.
 
And
 
so,
 
yes,
 
and
 
I
 
agree
 
with
 
you.
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
no,
 
I'm
 
not
 
looking
 
to
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
to
 
do.
 
I'm
 
not,
 
I'm
 
not,
 
I
 
actually
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
reasons
 
is,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
bringing
 
somebody
 
who
 
knows
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
marketing.
 
Beyond
 
what
 
I,
 
so
 
again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
as
 
I,
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
learned
 
this
 
based
 
on
 
experience
 
in
 
this
 
past
 
few
 
years
 
that
 
I've
 
been
 
practicing.
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
saw
 
patients,
 
I
 
saw
 
the
 
need,
 
I
 
see
 
what
 
works,
 
I
 
see
 
what
 
doesn't
 
work.
 
We
 
can
 
create
 
a
 
structure
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
have,
 
we
 
have
 
certain
 
responsibilities.
 
I
 
think
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
the,
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
is,
 
so
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
tasks
 
involved?
 
Obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
some
 
of
 
these,
 
some
 
of
 
these.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
big
 
decisions,
 
like,
 
for
 
example,
 
you
 
tell
 
me,
 
hey,
 
Amir,
 
my
 
idea
 
about,
 
for
 
example,
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
clinics
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
going
 
for
 
is
 
this,
 
and
 
I'm
 
not
 
willing
 
to
 
change
 
that.
 
This
 
is
 
just
 
something
 
that's
 
solid.
 
It's
 
written
 
in
 
stone.
 
There's
 
no
 
way
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
change
 
my
 
mind.
 
Then
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
have,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
okay,
 
so
 
either
 
I
 
agree
 
with
 
it,
 
or
 
I
 
disagree
 
with
 
it,
 
and
 
I
 
say,
 
look,
 
no,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
that
 
ideology
 
or
 
ideation.
 
Or
 
you
 
say,
 
no,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
I
 
am
 
open
 
to
 
basically,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
changing
 
this
 
however
 
we
 
want.
 
Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
can
 
talk
 
about
 
it,
 
we
 
can
 
think
 
about
 
it,
 
we
 
can
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
ideas.
 
The
 
issue
 
is,
 
how
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
this
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
manner?
 
To
 
get
 
it
 
to
 
a
 
point
 
that
 
it's,
 
it's
 
starting
 
to
 
generate
 
revenue.
 
I
 
mean,
 
so
 
you're
 
saying,
 
so
 
this
 
idea
 
of
 
$75,000
 
a
 
year,
 
I
 
mean,
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
you're
 
saying
 
it's
 
so
 
solid,
 
Oriel,
 
if
 
you
 
think
 
that
 
100%,
 
100%,
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
make
 
to
 
make
 
$75,000
 
a
 
month
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2026,
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
it's
 
solid.
 
Like,
 
for
 
you.

Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
go
 
and
 
do
 
that.
 
 
@14:34
 
-
 
Amir
 
Because
 
if
 
you're
 
100%,
 
if
 
your
 
projection
 
is
 
100%
 
that
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
making
 
that,
 
perfect.
 
I
 
mean,
 
why
 
would
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
even
 
share
 
it
 
with
 
me?
 
Like,
 
if
 
I
 
had
 
an
 
idea,
 
if
 
I
 
thought
 
my
 
marketing
 
company
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
generate
 
almost
 
a
 
million
 
dollar
 
revenue,
 
and
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2026,
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
want
 
anyone.
 
So,
 
so
 
that's
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
think
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I,
 
that
 
that's
 
just
 
a
 
word
 
of
 
wisdom
 
for
 
you,
 
if
 
you
 
really.
 
The
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
that
 
product,
 
go
 
execute
 
it
 
because
 
that's
 
something
 
that's
 
not
 
my
 
projection
 
for
 
my
 
marketing
 
company.
 
 
@15:10
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It
 
is
 
not.
 
 
@15:12
 
-
 
Amir
 
And
 
then
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
do,
 
so
 
for
 
example,
 
if
 
I'm
 
coming
 
with
 
my
 
ideas,
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
it.
 
So
 
I'm
 
coming
 
with
 
my
 
ideas
 
and
 
then
 
you're
 
coming
 
with
 
your
 
ideas.
 
Your
 
ideas
 
are
 
generating
 
$75,000
 
a
 
month.
 
My
 
ideas,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
generate.
 
It
 
can
 
generate
 
nothing
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2026.
 
So
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
burden
 
on
 
you
 
because
 
then
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
deal
 
with
 
my
 
ideas
 
as
 
well.
 
Okay.
 
 
@15:41

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
 
@15:43
 
-
 
Amir
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
think
 
that,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
think
 
that,
 
okay,
 
you
 
know
 
what?
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
product.
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
You
 
know,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
aim
 
for
 
$75,000
 
a
 
month,
 
but
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
possibility
 
that
 
it
 
may
 
or
 
may
 
not
 
happen.
 
Of
 
course
 
there
 
is.
 
Then
 
you
 
can
 
leverage
 
my,
 
you
 
know,
 
My
 
expertise,
 
my
 
connections,
 
because
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
day,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
about
 
how
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
approaching
 
different
 
clients,
 
so
 
when
 
you're
 
approaching
 
the
 
clients,
 
then
 
I
 
can
 
approach
 
them.
 
I
 
can
 
say,
 
hey,
 
what's
 
up,
 
doc?
 
Let
 
me
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
I
 
have,
 
see
 
if
 
it
 
works
 
for
 
you.
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
works
 
really
 
well
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
it
 
that
 
way.
 
What
 
are
 
your
 
thoughts?
 
 
@16:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
obviously
 
the
 
$75
 
a
 
month
 
is
 
not
 
set
 
in
 
stone.
 
It
 
cannot
 
be
 
set
 
in
 
stone,
 
because
 
that's
 
business.
 
It's
 
obvious.
 
The
 
thing
 
is,
 
because
 
of
 
my
 
environment,
 
I
 
am
 
in
 
an
 
environment
 
of
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
entrepreneurs
 
that
 
run
 
agencies,
 
not
 
specifically
 
in
 
the
 
mental
 
health
 
space,
 
but
 
in
 
other
 
spaces.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
if
 
it's
 
mess
 
spas,
 
auto
 
detailing,
 
roofing,
 
tree
 
removal,
 
doesn't
 
matter.
 
Point
 
is,
 
I
 
am
 
working
 
currently
 
and
 
learning
 
and
 
interacting
 
with
 
people
 
that
 
scale
 
their
 
agencies.
 
your
 
utilised
 
numbers,
 
define
 
In
 
the
 
span
 
of
 
three
 
months,
 
from
 
$15,000
 
a
 
month
 
to
 
$55,000,
 
$60,000
 
a
 
month.
 
So
 
this
 
reality
 
is
 
possible
 
for
 
me.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
comes
 
and
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
reach
 
that.
 
There's
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
pillars
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
reach
 
that
 
milestone.
 
It's
 
basically
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
see
 
it,
 
and
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
how
 
I
 
see
 
it.
 
There's
 
a
 
winning
 
duo
 
here
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
mind
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
marketing
 
and
 
understanding
 
strategy
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
You
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
mind
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
understanding
 
clinic
 
owners
 
and
 
also
 
sales.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
clinic
 
owners
 
need.
 
This
 
is
 
all
 
they
 
need.
 
They
 
need
 
the
 
marketing
 
side
 
to
 
be
 
said
 
and
 
understand
 
how
 
it
 
works.
 
And
 
you
 
need
 
someone
 
to
 
lead
 
them
 
in
 
that
 
way.
 
And
 
they
 
also
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
to
 
sell
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
get
 
people
 
to
 
come
 
into
 
the
 
clinic
 
itself.
 
And
 
you've
 
cracked
 
that.
 
So
 
once
 
you
 
combine
 
these
 
two
 
things,
 
having
 
the
 
tools
 
in
 
place,
 
such
 
as
 
voice
 
AI
 
or
 
hiring.
 
Or
 
creating
 
a
 
call
 
center,
 
I
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
tools
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
I
 
have
 
everything.
 
There's
 
a
 
whole
 
module
 
in
 
the
 
coaching
 
program
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
that
 
is
 
showing
 
you
 
exactly
 
how
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
call
 
center
 
from
 
zero
 
to
 
100
 
in
 
a
 
month.
 
That's
 
possible.
 
So
 
the
 
tools
 
are
 
not
 
the
 
problem.
 
The
 
thing
 
is
 
the
 
product.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
why
 
I
 
also
 
believe
 
it's
 
possible
 
to
 
reach
 
that
 
revenue
 
goal.
 
Because
 
when
 
the
 
product
 
is
 
right,
 
the
 
LTV
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
high
 
because
 
people
 
are
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
leave
 
you.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
high
 
churn,
 
then
 
you're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
reach
 
that
 
goal.
 
Because
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
people
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
leave
 
you,
 
obviously.
 
Second
 
of
 
all,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
you
 
a
 
bad
 
reputation.
 
And
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
things.
 
So
 
when
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
about
 
that
 
goal,
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
about
 
it
 
with
 
a
 
working
 
product,
 
an
 
LTV
 
of
 
at
 
least
 
$15,000.
 
At
 
least,
 
that's
 
the
 
bare
 
minimum.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
getting
 
word
 
to
 
mouth
 
at
 
a
 
certain
 
point
 
to
 
play
 
for
 
itself.
 
Okay,
 
and
 
also
 
content.
 
And
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
you,
 
because
 
of
 
your
 
story,
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
I'm
 
absolutely,
 
I'm
 
unbelievable
 
at.
 
It's
 
creating
 
story-based
 
ads,
 
okay?
 
Every
 
single
 
client
 
of
 
mine
 
who
 
I
 
created
 
a
 
story
 
ad
 
for
 
has
 
generated
 
hundreds
 
of
 
thousands
 
of
 
dollars
 
from
 
a
 
single
 
ad,
 
which
 
is
 
their
 
story.
 
And
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
story,
 
a
 
story
 
that
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
can
 
relate
 
to.
 
So
 
in
 
my
 
eyes,
 
if
 
we
 
create
 
just
 
one
 
ad
 
of
 
your
 
story,
 
of
 
you
 
in
 
the
 
clinic
 
working
 
with
 
patients,
 
whatever
 
that
 
is,
 
talking
 
about
 
what
 
you
 
did,
 
showing
 
how
 
many
 
ads
 
you
 
run,
 
showing
 
your
 
expertise,
 
or
 
even
 
running
 
a
 
webinar
 
of
 
sort
 
and
 
getting
 
200
 
clinic
 
owners
 
inside
 
there,
 
you
 
can
 
sell
 
10,
 
to
 
20,
 
to
 
30
 
clinics
 
in
 
an
 
hour.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
is
 
having
 
the,
 
you
 
know,
 
having
 
the,
 
what's
 
it
 
called?
 
How's
 
it
 
called?
 
The
 
base?
 
Not
 
the
 
base.
 
The
 
foundations
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
That's
 
the
 
only
 
thing.
 
So,
 
and
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
that,
 
of
 
course,
 
we
 
can
 
start
 
slow,
 
see
 
if
 
our
 
dynamic
 
even
 
works,
 
okay?
 
Okay.
 
And
 
once
 
we
 
see
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
something
 
that
 
works,
 
scaling
 
is
 
the
 
easy
 
part.
 
Scaling
 
is
 
definitely
 
the
 
easy
 
part.
 
You
 
only
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
foundations
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
and
 
the
 
people
 
to
 
actually
 
execute
 
on
 
that.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
why
 
I
 
believe
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
possible
 
with
 
both
 
of
 
our
 
skill
 
levels
 
and
 
expertise
 
in
 
two
 
different
 
sides
 
of
 
things.
 
Because
 
I've
 
seen
 
your
 
ads,
 
and
 
I'll
 
be
 
100%
 
honest
 
with
 
you,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
your
 
lead
 
costs
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Your
 
ads
 
can
 
be
 
improved.
 
They
 
can
 
be
 
improved.
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
be
 
improved.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
get
 
60,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
see
 
60
 
to
 
70
 
patients
 
a
 
day
 
from
 
these
 
ads,
 
and
 
I
 
come
 
insider,
 
there's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
point,
 
like
 
I
 
have
 
clients
 
that
 
tell
 
me,
 
Oriel,
 
just
 
stop
 
the
 
campaigns.
 
I
 
cannot
 
keep
 
up
 
with
 
this.
 
So
 
it's
 
possible.
 
It
 
just
 
depends.
 
There's
 
foundations
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
set
 
in
 
place.
 
Once
 
these
 
are
 
set
 
in
 
place,
 
everything's
 
easier.
 
And
 
I'm
 
pretty
 
sure
 
that
 
you
 
already
 
know
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
know,
 
as
 
well,
 
what
 
you
 
think.
 
So,
 
I
 
mean,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
yeah,
 
obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
I
 
understand
 
all
 
of
 
them.
 
 
@21:06

Amir
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
approached
 
you.
 
I'm,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
thinking
 
about
 
is
 
how
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
working
 
together,
 
how
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
structuring
 
it?
 
Would
 
you
 
be
 
open
 
to
 
something
 
like
 
this?
 
Would
 
you
 
be
 
open
 
to
 
having
 
the
 
company,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'll
 
be
 
the
 
owner
 
of
 
the
 
company
 
100%
 
for
 
nine
 
months.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
work
 
together
 
50-50.
 
Financially,
 
50-50,
 
we're
 
going
 
to,
 
whatever
 
we
 
We
 
make,
 
we
 
take.
 
And
 
then
 
after
 
nine
 
months,
 
if
 
you're
 
still
 
working
 
together
 
and
 
working
 
well,
 
then
 
we
 
divide
 
the
 
company
 
into
 
50%
 
your
 
equity
 
and
 
50%
 
mine.
 
Or
 
51-49.
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
some
 
time.
 
The
 
reason
 
for
 
that,
 
Oriel,
 
is
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
also,
 
you
 
know,
 
you,
 
as
 
I
 
said,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
working
 
process
 
for
 
yourself.
 
You
 
have
 
a
 
projection.
 
And
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
working
 
process
 
for
 
myself,
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
projection.
 
I
 
really
 
think
 
that,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I,
 
if
 
I
 
create
 
Bright
 
Horizons
 
marketing.
 
And
 
put
 
my
 
face
 
on
 
it,
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
product
 
that
 
I
 
have,
 
because
 
I,
 
again,
 
I've
 
seen
 
the
 
products
 
that
 
are
 
out
 
there.
 
Not
 
only,
 
I
 
mean,
 
ads
 
are
 
the
 
first
 
thing
 
that
 
happens.
 
I
 
mean,
 
honestly,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
voice
 
bots
 
and
 
the
 
AI
 
bots
 
that
 
the
 
other
 
companies
 
are
 
using,
 
they
 
suck.
 
 
@22:15
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
They
 
don't
 
do
 
anything.
 
 
@22:17
 
-
 
Amir
 
You
 
know,
 
I've
 
created
 
a
 
voice
 
AI
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
my
 
calendar,
 
my
 
consult
 
calendar
 
for
 
last
 
week
 
was
 
38
 
consults.
 
And
 
it
 
wasn't
 
live
 
person,
 
it
 
was
 
the
 
voice
 
AI
 
that
 
generated
 
38
 
consults.
 
So
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
this
 
product,
 
mean,
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
find
 
the
 
right
 
people
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
make
 
it
 
what
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
make
 
it.
 
But
 
I
 
am,
 
but
 
I'm
 
not
 
willing
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
give
 
it
 
away
 
right
 
away,
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
who
 
you
 
are.
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
your
 
level
 
of
 
expertise
 
are.
 
You,
 
I
 
mean,
 
you,
 
you,
 
you,
 
you
 
are
 
saying
 
you
 
work
 
with
 
Greenbrooks
 
and
 
one
 
more
 
company,
 
I
 
mean,
 
where
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
that
 
much
 
experience
 
in,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
market.
 
don't,
 
I,
 
and
 
Greenbrooks
 
is
 
just
 
so,
 
it
 
is
 
so.
 
Closed
 
box.
 
mean,
 
I
 
cannot
 
find,
 
if
 
you
 
would
 
tell
 
me,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
work
 
with
 
Clinic
 
X
 
in
 
Utah,
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
easier
 
because
 
I
 
could
 
just
 
go
 
see
 
the
 
ads,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
talk
 
to
 
the
 
guy
 
who's
 
like,
 
with
 
Greenbrook's,
 
who
 
am
 
I
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
to?
 
Like,
 
there's
 
no
 
way
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
know,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
you're
 
doing.
 
And,
 
of
 
course,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
can
 
have,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
again,
 
I'm
 
to
 
go
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
video,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
have
 
all
 
these
 
marketing
 
companies
 
back
 
in
 
Israel
 
that
 
are
 
working
 
really
 
well
 
for
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
products.
 
But
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
day,
 
are
 
you
 
working
 
with
 
U.S.
 
neuromodulation
 
clinics?
 
And
 
then,
 
yes,
 
Greenbrook's
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
company.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
can,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
continue
 
working
 
with
 
them,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
fruitful
 
for
 
you.
 
But
 
that
 
doesn't
 
tell
 
me
 
anything
 
about,
 
like,
 
who
 
are
 
you
 
in
 
a
 
neuromodulation
 
practice
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
that
 
door
 
for
 
you.
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
opening
 
that
 
door
 
for
 
you
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
to
 
just
 
seat
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
patients,
 
not
 
patients,
 
clinics.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
my
 
technical
 
guy.
 
Because
 
it's
 
difficult.
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
know
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
tools,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
exactly
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
them.
 
have,
 
again,
 
I
 
told
 
you,
 
have
 
freelancers
 
who
 
are
 
doing
 
it.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
having
 
a
 
technical
 
person
 
who
 
knows
 
exactly
 
what
 
it
 
is
 
and
 
invest
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
company,
 
that's
 
a
 
different
 
story.
 
So
 
what
 
are
 
your
 
thoughts
 
about
 
that?
 
 
@24:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
neuromodulation
 
marketing,
 
that's
 
right.
 
Yes,
 
I
 
do
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
more
 
work
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
signing
 
clients.
 
have
 
approximately
 
more
 
10
 
sales
 
calls
 
this
 
week.
 
Okay.
 
Because
 
of
 
my
 
dad's
 
passing
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
it's
 
been
 
difficult
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
continue
 
on
 
with
 
posting
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
I
 
didn't
 
close
 
clients
 
that
 
I
 
was
 
supposed
 
to
 
close.
 
Just,
 
yeah,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
look
 
good
 
on
 
paper.
 
There
 
is
 
this
 
one
 
clinic
 
though,
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
went
 
over
 
in
 
the
 
video.
 
It's
 
called
 
Hope
 
and
 
Wellness
 
Psychiatric
 
Clinic.
 
I
 
went
 
over
 
their
 
results.
 
Hope
 
and
 
Wellness
 
Psychiatric
 
Clinic.
 
They
 
are
 
based
 
in
 
Arkansas.
 
The
 
owner
 
is
 
Sean's
 
Floors.
 
So
 
I'm
 
running
 
the
 
ads
 
for
 
them.
 
I'm
 
running
 
the
 
video
 
ads.
 
And
 
I
 
also,
 
in
 
the
 
video...
 
I
 
went
 
through,
 
went
 
over
 
the
 
results
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@25:06
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
got
 
them
 
a
 
proc.
 
How
 
many,
 
what
 
type
 
of
 
TMS
 
machines
 
they
 
have?
 
 
@25:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
they're
 
doing
 
Spravato.
 
 
@25:13
 
-
 
Amir
 
Only
 
Spravato.
 
 
@25:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@25:14
 
-
 
Amir
 
How
 
many
 
patients
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis?
 
 
@25:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
On
 
a
 
daily
 
basis,
 
I
 
actually
 
do
 
not
 
know
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
daily
 
patients
 
that
 
they
 
see.
 
 
@25:22
 
-
 
Amir
 
How
 
many
 
new
 
patients
 
they
 
sign
 
up
 
per
 
month?
 
 
@25:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
per
 
month,
 
it
 
is
 
about
 
five
 
per
 
month,
 
I
 
know,
 
for
 
my
 
stuff.
 
Okay.
 
They
 
do
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
though.
 
Yeah.
 
They
 
do
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
their
 
follow-up
 
and
 
also
 
sales
 
process
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
went,
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
them
 
about
 
that.
 
Our
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
was
 
approximately
 
60
 
bucks,
 
but
 
because
 
they
 
book
 
people
 
so
 
far
 
away,
 
like
 
a
 
week,
 
two
 
weeks
 
in
 
advance,
 
and
 
they
 
don't
 
take
 
credit
 
cards,
 
people
 
just
 
don't
 
show
 
up.
 
Okay.
 
 
@25:51
 
-
 
Amir
 
And
 
that's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
have.
 
How
 
does
 
that
 
work?
 
 
@25:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No.
 
On
 
the
 
phone
 
call,
 
taking
 
credit
 
cards
 
to
 
secure
 
their...
 
Oh,
 
so
 
you
 
do
 
that?
 
I
 
didn't
 
understand
 
the
 
question.
 
No.
 
Oh,
 
you
 
don't
 
do
 
that?
 
How
 
far
 
away
 
do
 
you
 
book
 
people?
 
 
@26:07
 
-
 
Amir
 
For
 
the
 
new
 
patients?
 
 
@26:10
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
for
 
people
 
that
 
come
 
to
 
a
 
consultation
 
in
 
the
 
clinic
 
itself,
 
or
 
are
 
you
 
doing
 
Zoom
 
consult
 
the
 
next
 
day.
 
So
 
you
 
see,
 
that's
 
the
 
problem
 
that
 
they
 
have.
 
When
 
you
 
book,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
pretty
 
sure
 
I
 
know
 
this,
 
if
 
you
 
book
 
more
 
than
 
four
 
days
 
ahead,
 
people
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
throw
 
its
 
drop.
 
And
 
that's
 
their
 
main
 
problem.
 
So
 
if,
 
and
 
that's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
need,
 
that's
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
transfer
 
to
 
the
 
clinics,
 
because
 
people
 
don't
 
understand
 
that.
 
 
@26:32
 
-
 
Amir
 
You
 
know,
 
this
 
problem,
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
the
 
solution
 
to
 
that
 
problem.
 
I
 
solved
 
that
 
problem.
 
Why
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
I'm
 
sitting
 
here
 
talking
 
to
 
you
 
for
 
an
 
hour
 
and
 
I'm
 
not
 
seeing
 
patients?
 
You
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
solve
 
that
 
problem.
 
 
@26:45
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@26:46
 
-
 
Amir
 
Okay.
 
There's
 
a
 
reason
 
that
 
I
 
can't
 
see.
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I,
 
if
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
patient
 
right
 
after
 
this,
 
if
 
they
 
say
 
there's
 
a
 
patient
 
outside,
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
esketamine,
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
them
 
now?
 
I'll
 
see
 
them
 
right
 
after
 
this
 
call.
 
Because
 
I
 
I
 
have
 
any
 
patients.
 
 
@27:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Is
 
it
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
nurse
 
practitioners
 
or?
 
 
@27:08
 
-
 
Amir
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
obviously
 
it's
 
because
 
of
 
nurse
 
practitioners,
 
but
 
how
 
are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
it?
 
Are
 
you
 
going
 
to,
 
how
 
are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
nurse
 
practitioner
 
so
 
trustworthy
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
delegate
 
and
 
then
 
just
 
sit
 
here
 
without,
 
I
 
mean,
 
nobody
 
comes
 
knocking
 
on
 
my
 
door
 
and
 
60
 
patients
 
are
 
being
 
seen
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis.
 
 
@27:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
and
 
this
 
is,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
skill
 
thing.
 
 
@27:29
 
-
 
Amir
 
The
 
skill
 
set
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
again,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
yes,
 
the
 
ad
 
is
 
good.
 
Everything
 
is
 
good.
 
But
 
running
 
a
 
clinic,
 
running
 
a
 
neuromodulation
 
clinic
 
is
 
a
 
different
 
ball
 
game.
 
And
 
then
 
five
 
new
 
patients.
 
And
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
yes.
 
I
 
mean,
 
if
 
they're
 
signing
 
up
 
five
 
new
 
patients
 
with
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
seeing
 
them
 
two
 
weeks
 
down,
 
that's
 
pretty
 
good.

What
 
is
 
their
 
ad
 
budget?
 
They're
 
running
 
about
 
a
 
thousand.
 
 
@27:54
 
-
 
Amir
 
No,
 
they're
 
only
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
I'm
 
not
 
running
 
with
 
Google.

A
 
thousand
 
dollars
 
a
 
month,
 
approximately.
 
They're
 
also,
 
their
 
area
 
is
 
extremely
 
small.
 
Which
 
makes
 
it
 
a
 
bit
 
harder.
 
It's
 
only
 
80,000
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
Facebook
 
radius
 
as
 
well.
 
Really?
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
bit,
 
and
 
we're
 
still
 
getting
 
$11
 
leads,
 
you
 
know.
 
But
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
lead
 
cost
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
thing.
 
The
 
lead,
 
it's
 
what
 
you're
 
talking
 
about.
 
Having
 
the
 
process
 
in
 
place
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
people,
 
you
 
know,
 
get
 
called
 
right
 
then
 
and
 
there.
 
And
 
they
 
also
 
get
 
booked
 
a
 
day
 
after,
 
two
 
days
 
after,
 
and
 
not
 
more
 
than
 
that.
 
And
 
yes,
 
you're
 
right.
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
skills
 
to
 
teach
 
people
 
how
 
to
 
delegate
 
that
 
to
 
nurses.
 
I
 
don't.
 
I
 
am
 
aware
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
also
 
why
 
I
 
said
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
disleverage.
 
 
@28:35
 
-
 
Amir
 
So.
 
Yeah.
 
didn't
 
want
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
don't
 
get
 
me
 
wrong.
 
I
 
didn't
 
want
 
to
 
rub
 
it
 
in
 
your
 
face
 
or
 
anything.
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
saying
 
that
 
the,
 
so
 
the
 
reason
 
that
 
I'm
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
very
 
confident
 
in
 
my
 
marketing
 
strategy
 
is
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
it
 
works.
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
teach
 
it
 
to
 
someone.
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
I
 
need
 
is
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
somebody
 
who
 
can
 
handle
 
the
 
technical
 
stuff.
 
However,
 
you
 
are
 
different
 
because
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
not
 
only
 
technical,
 
but
 
also
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
involved
 
in.
 
In
 
sales
 
and
 
communication
 
with
 
practices,
 
and
 
you
 
do
 
have
 
the
 
skills.
 
The
 
reason
 
I
 
didn't
 
want
 
my
 
freelancers
 
to
 
be
 
involved
 
because
 
they
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
talk.
 
They
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
how
 
to
 
present
 
themselves.
 
But
 
you
 
clearly
 
have
 
the
 
charisma
 
and
 
the
 
tools
 
that
 
one
 
needs
 
to
 
start
 
making
 
that
 
connection
 
with
 
people.
 
So
 
I
 
think,
 
again,
 
I
 
really
 
don't
 
think
 
I
 
would
 
go
 
any
 
other
 
way
 
unless
 
you
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
a
 
very
 
different
 
out-of-the-box
 
thinking.
 
I
 
would
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
you
 
for
 
at
 
least
 
nine
 
months
 
to
 
have
 
complete
 
confidence
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
business
 
partner
 
with
 
you.
 
A
 
business
 
partnership
 
is
 
something
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
create
 
the
 
best
 
marketing
 
company
 
in
 
the
 
field,
 
and
 
then
 
if
 
we
 
don't
 
agree
 
on
 
something,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
just
 
break
 
it.
 
So,
 
because
 
we
 
have
 
disagreements.
 
So,
 
I
 
am
 
not
 
a
 
person
 
who...
 
I
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
to
 
do,
 
obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
would
 
guide
 
and
 
be
 
open
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
my
 
opinions,
 
but
 
I
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
freedom
 
to
 
do
 
what
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do,
 
and
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
would
 
consult
 
with
 
each
 
other,
 
and
 
obviously,
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
day,
 
I
 
want
 
this
 
product
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
very
 
successful
 
product.
 
If
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
your
 
idea
 
is
 
better
 
than
 
mine,
 
or
 
my
 
idea
 
is
 
better
 
than
 
yours,
 
I
 
will
 
fight
 
for
 
each
 
idea
 
the
 
same
 
amount.
 
But
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
myself,
 
Oriel,
 
working,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
in
 
this
 
nine
 
months,
 
there
 
are
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
things
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
learn.
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
are
 
you
 
dedicated
 
enough?
 
Second
 
of
 
all,
 
are
 
you
 
who
 
you
 
say
 
you
 
are?
 
Third
 
of
 
all,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
are
 
your
 
skills
 
to
 
the
 
level
 
that
 
you're
 
explaining?
 
Again,
 
I'm
 
not
 
saying
 
you're
 
wrong.
 
100%,
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
not
 
saying
 
that
 
you're
 
lying,
 
but
 
if
 
this
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
because
 
I
 
agree
 
with
 
you,
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
if
 
we
 
charge,
 
if
 
you
 
have,
 
that's
 
It's
 
30
 
clients,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
charge
 
each
 
of
 
them
 
$5,000
 
to
 
$7,000
 
a
 
month,
 
and
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
our
 
overhead
 
would
 
be
 
one-third
 
of
 
that,
 
so
 
the
 
company
 
will
 
be
 
generating
 
$100,000.
 
I
 
see
 
that
 
happening
 
in
 
a
 
year,
 
two
 
years,
 
and
 
very
 
close
 
to
 
the
 
goal
 
that
 
you're
 
thinking
 
about,
 
but
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
just
 
say,
 
okay,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
giving
 
this
 
a
 
million-dollar
 
idea.
 
It
 
is
 
a
 
million-dollar
 
idea
 
to
 
give
 
it
 
away
 
because
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
into
 
a
 
partnership
 
with
 
somebody
 
from
 
the
 
get-go.
 
 
@31:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
It
 
makes
 
complete
 
sense.
 
Question
 
is,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
questions,
 
okay?
 
One
 
is
 
what
 
made
 
you,
 
because
 
you
 
said
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
successful
 
practice.
 
You
 
reached
 
unbelievable
 
goals
 
in
 
a
 
very
 
short
 
amount
 
of
 
time,
 
okay?
 
I've
 
done
 
some,
 
I've
 
done
 
research.
 
You
 
only
 
finished
 
your
 
John
 
Hopkins,
 
John
 
And
 
then,
 
and
 
how
 
John
 
Hopkins
 
is.
 
 
@32:01
 
-
 
Amir
 
How's
 
it
 
called?
 
 
@32:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Resonance.
 
Yeah,
 
Resonance
 
in
 
2023.
 
So
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
you
 
got
 
to
 
what
 
you
 
are
 
now
 
in
 
this
 
short
 
of
 
a
 
time
 
span
 
is
 
incredible.
 
So
 
the
 
question
 
is,
 
what
 
makes
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
opening
 
this
 
marketing
 
company
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
place
 
instead
 
of
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
expanding
 
the
 
business
 
that
 
you
 
obviously
 
have
 
working
 
very
 
well
 
now
 
and
 
you
 
crack
 
the
 
code
 
on
 
it?
 
Because
 
with
 
two
 
or
 
three
 
practices,
 
you
 
can
 
definitely
 
get
 
to
 
$10
 
million
 
a
 
year
 
like
 
that.
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
first
 
question.
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
question
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
after
 
that.
 
 
@32:29
 
-
 
Amir
 
So
 
it's
 
actually
 
a
 
very
 
simple
 
answer
 
to
 
that
 
question.
 
So
 
running
 
a
 
practice
 
is
 
very
 
risky.
 
You
 
know,
 
we're
 
seeing
 
patients.
 
And
 
with
 
each
 
practice,
 
Oriel,
 
I
 
have,
 
so
 
now
 
I
 
have
 
11
 
employees.
 
You
 
need
 
HR.
 
You
 
need
 
insurance.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
benefits.
 
There's,
 
there's
 
with,
 
with.
 
There's
 
drama
 
with
 
patients.
 
You
 
have
 
to,
 
because
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
certain
 
number
 
of
 
patients
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
generate
 
that
 
amount
 
of
 
income,
 
that
 
amount
 
of
 
revenue.
 
It's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
easy.
 
Yes,
 
I
 
know.
 
If
 
I
 
open
 
another
 
office,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'll
 
go
 
20
 
miles
 
toward
 
D.C.
 
and
 
just
 
photocopy
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing
 
right
 
there,
 
because
 
I
 
know
 
I'm
 
the
 
most
 
successful
 
clinic
 
in
 
Maryland,
 
Virginia,
 
and
 
D.C.
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
creating
 
another
 
copy
 
of
 
mine,
 
maybe
 
not
 
as
 
successful,
 
because
 
we
 
are
 
here,
 
and
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
further.
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
30
 
miles,
 
40
 
miles,
 
and
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
that
 
far,
 
because
 
I
 
live
 
here.
 
So
 
the
 
main
 
thing,
 
the
 
main
 
reason
 
is
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
headache
 
that
 
a
 
practice
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
for
 
me.
 
Am
 
I
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
doing
 
it?
 
Yes,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
three
 
or
 
four
 
or
 
five.
 
Maybe
 
I
 
have
 
another
 
one,
 
and
 
then
 
that's
 
it.
 
And
 
the
 
reason
 
for
 
that
 
is
 
because
 
of,
 
you
 
know,
 
internal
 
reasons.
 
Like,
 
know,
 
I
 
have
 
providers,
 
have
 
nurse
 
practitioners
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
partner,
 
and
 
then
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
them
 
partner,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
other
 
clinics
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
be
 
invested
 
in
 
those
 
clinics.
 
So
 
I
 
have
 
other
 
reasons
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
but,
 
but
 
finding,
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
again,
 
having
 
an
 
entrepreneurship
 
mindset
 
is
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
create
 
a
 
product
 
that
 
generates
 
the
 
safest
 
amount
 
of
 
passive
 
income?
 
Because
 
look
 
at
 
this,
 
look
 
at,
 
look
 
at
 
TMS
 
and
 
escadamine.
 
TMS
 
and
 
escadamine
 
is
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
passive
 
income
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
involved
 
in
 
that,
 
but,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
techs
 
are
 
doing
 
it
 
and
 
then
 
that's
 
it.
 
So
 
to
 
my
 
mindset
 
is
 
that
 
what
 
can
 
we
 
do
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
put
 
the
 
least
 
amount
 
of
 
work
 
and
 
generate
 
the
 
most
 
amount
 
of,
 
most
 
amount
 
of
 
money.
 
And
 
with
 
marketing
 
companies,
 
it's
 
the
 
same,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
after
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
polished
 
system,
 
it's
 
just
 
changing
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
then
 
like,
 
you
 
making
 
sure
 
the
 
SEO
 
is
 
running
 
correctly.
 
And
 
then
 
we,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
hire
 
people
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
We
 
hire
 
all
 
these
 
like,
 
you
 
Instead
 
of
 
freelancers,
 
we
 
can
 
hire
 
people
 
as
 
full-time
 
employees
 
who
 
are
 
completely
 
invested
 
and
 
they're
 
doing
 
it.
 
But
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
day,
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
risks?
 
Let's
 
be
 
honest,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
30
 
to
 
40
 
clients,
 
we
 
are
 
set.
 
We
 
don't
 
need
 
more
 
than
 
that.
 
And
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
actually
 
I
 
forgot
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
marketing
 
tools
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
using
 
in
 
the
 
website
 
and
 
everything
 
and
 
in
 
my
 
sales
 
pitch,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
selling
 
that.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
a
 
good
 
fit
 
for
 
me,
 
not
 
that
 
I'm
 
a
 
good
 
fit
 
for
 
you.
 
I
 
mean,
 
do
 
you
 
even
 
worthy
 
of
 
sharing,
 
you
 
know,
 
do
 
you
 
even
 
have
 
the
 
desire
 
to
 
be
 
another
 
Bright
 
Horizons
 
psychiatrist?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
what
 
it
 
takes?
 
So
 
instead
 
of
 
selling
 
to
 
them,
 
want
 
to,
 
my
 
goal
 
is
 
after
 
a
 
year,
 
have
 
the
 
companies
 
beg
 
to
 
be.
 
Be
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
marketing
 
program,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
it.
 
mean,
 
as
 
long
 
as,
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
what's
 
happening
 
with
 
all,
 
and
 
again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
that's
 
another
 
thing,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
I
 
realized.
 
What
 
happens
 
with,
 
like,
 
Beyond
 
Marketing
 
and
 
Raise4
 
and
 
whatever,
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
companies,
 
when
 
they
 
go
 
on
 
their
 
sales
 
calls,
 
they're
 
selling.
 
Oh,
 
my
 
God,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you,
 
like,
 
you
 
100
 
clicks.
 
My
 
cost
 
per
 
click
 
is,
 
like,
 
$3.
 
That's
 
not
 
what
 
I'm
 
to
 
say.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
say
 
that,
 
yeah,
 
you
 
want
 
clients,
 
you
 
want
 
patients
 
on
 
your
 
chair.
 
I
 
can
 
prove
 
it
 
to
 
you
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
patients
 
on
 
my
 
chair.
 
And
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
job
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
two
 
or
 
three
 
clients
 
and
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
generating
 
what
 
you
 
are
 
promising,
 
after
 
that
 
is
 
easy.
 
After
 
that,
 
it's
 
like
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
anything.
 
People
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
beg
 
you
 
to
 
be
 
part
 
of
 
your
 
system,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
pick
 
and
 
choose.
 
And
 
again,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
system
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
how
 
am
 
I
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
going
 
toward,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
clinic.
 
plan,
 
can't
 
do
 
be
 
Do
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
pick
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
clinics,
 
and
 
then
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
know
 
that
 
I
 
was
 
thinking
 
about
 
is,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
share
 
that
 
with
 
you.

Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
cool.

Amir
 
But
 
that's,
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
long-winded
 
answer,
 
but
 
that's
 
the
 
reason
 
for
 
it.
 
 
@37:23

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
I
 
thought
 
about,
 
which
 
could
 
be
 
even
 
easier
 
on
 
us,
 
and
 
even
 
on
 
you
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
is
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
business
 
consultants
 
in
 
which
 
I'm
 
working
 
with.
 
I
 
went
 
over
 
their
 
ads
 
as
 
well
 
in
 
the
 
video
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you,
 
and
 
they
 
are
 
partners
 
as
 
well.
 
One
 
is
 
marketing,
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
is
 
more
 
of
 
a
 
sales
 
product
 
person,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
coaching
 
program
 
in
 
Israel
 
for
 
business
 
owners,
 
but
 
it's
 
for
 
all
 
types
 
of
 
business
 
owners.
 
All
 
types
 
of
 
business
 
owners,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
this
 
thing
 
in
 
which
 
they,
 
once
 
every
 
three
 
months,
 
they
 
run
 
a
 
challenge,
 
an
 
online
 
challenge.
 
and
 
get
 
It's
 
a
 
four-day
 
life
 
challenge
 
in
 
which
 
they're
 
going
 
over
 
the
 
four
 
pillars
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
scale
 
your
 
business,
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah.
 
In
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
challenge,
 
they
 
sell
 
a
 
$10,000
 
product,
 
which
 
is
 
basically
 
them
 
teaching
 
you
 
how
 
to
 
build
 
an
 
insane
 
business,
 
a
 
big
 
business,
 
giving
 
you
 
all
 
the
 
tools,
 
all
 
the
 
knowledge,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
That's
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
done.
 
I
 
asked
 
for
 
the
 
syllabus
 
of
 
their
 
program
 
as
 
well
 
and
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
they
 
structure
 
it.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
basically
 
create
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
and
 
not
 
even
 
run
 
their
 
marketing,
 
but
 
teach
 
them
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
themselves.
 
So
 
that's
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
happening.
 
It's
 
less
 
of
 
a
 
passive
 
income
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
three
 
months,
 
but
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
you're
 
sophisticating
 
the
 
clinic
 
owners.
 
By
 
giving
 
them
 
the
 
tools
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
themselves,
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
they're
 
probably
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
even
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
run
 
their
 
marketing
 
on
 
their
 
own.
 
They
 
would
 
want,
 
you
 
know,
 
obviously
 
they
 
would
 
want
 
coaching
 
and
 
want
 
people
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
with
 
sales
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Let's
 
Let's
 
Let's
 
Thank
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
create
 
this
 
whole
 
community
 
of
 
clinic
 
owners
 
that
 
are
 
basically
 
working
 
together,
 
having
 
this
 
coaching
 
program,
 
and
 
then
 
having
 
the
 
LTV
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
having
 
a
 
monthly
 
coaching
 
program
 
that
 
they
 
pay
 
$500
 
a
 
month
 
for,
 
or
 
whatever
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
and
 
they
 
can
 
hop
 
on
 
sales
 
calls,
 
they
 
can,
 
you
 
know,
 
role
 
play
 
with
 
one
 
another,
 
or
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
coaching
 
calls
 
of
 
me
 
going
 
over
 
marketing,
 
coaching
 
calls
 
of
 
you
 
going
 
over
 
how
 
to
 
train
 
clinicians,
 
or
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
sales,
 
or,
 
you
 
know,
 
show
 
up
 
rate
 
tips,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
that's
 
also
 
a,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
direction
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
to,
 
and
 
that's,
 
as
 
well,
 
very,
 
very
 
safe,
 
and
 
also
 
creates
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
brand.
 
 
@39:37
 
-
 
Amir
 
So
 
absolutely,
 
absolutely,
 
Oriel,
 
but
 
think
 
about
 
it.
 
If
 
we
 
do
 
that
 
from
 
the
 
get
 
go,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
put
 
ourselves
 
in
 
a
 
position
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
right
 
now.
 
We
 
need
 
something
 
that
 
people
 
can
 
trust.
 
We
 
need
 
to,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
first,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
show
 
that
 
for
 
10,
 
20
 
clinics,
 
we
 
are
 
making
 
them
 
very
 
successful.
 
I
 
mean,
 
because,
 
I
 
mean,
 
why
 
a
 
busy
 
psychiatrist?
 
The
 
teacher's
 
gonna
 
come
 
and
 
take
 
that
 
course.
 
Well,
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
do
 
that.
 
I
 
mean,
 
like
 
a
 
year
 
ago,
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
do
 
that.
 
I'm
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
are
 
you
 
kidding
 
me?
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
it
 
myself.
 
You
 
are
 
talking
 
about
 
doctors,
 
Oriel.
 
They
 
have
 
big
 
egos.
 
They
 
think
 
they
 
are
 
the
 
best.
 
They
 
think
 
nobody
 
knows
 
better
 
than
 
them.
 
And
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
persuade
 
them
 
to
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
come
 
take
 
your
 
course.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
big
 
product.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
like
 
show
 
that,
 
hey,
 
dude,
 
this
 
works.
 
I
 
know
 
it
 
works.
 
I
 
can
 
prove
 
it
 
to
 
you
 
that
 
it
 
works.
 
Just,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
will
 
come.
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
a
 
wonderful
 
idea.
 
But
 
without
 
a
 
base,
 
they're
 
not
 
gonna
 
do
 
anything.
 
Even
 
if
 
I
 
show
 
them
 
my
 
success,
 
they're
 
gonna
 
be
 
like,
 
and
 
I
 
did.
 
I
 
actually
 
had
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
a
 
head
 
of
 
marketing
 
for
 
Brainsway.
 
And
 
because
 
it
 
was
 
actually
 
funny.
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
talking
 
to
 
my
 
Brainsway
 
rep
 
about
 
what
 
I
 
wanna
 
do.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
looking
 
at
 
just
 
giving
 
some
 
information.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
showed.
 
She
 
was
 
interested.
 
was
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
can
 
I
 
just
 
see
 
your
 
calendar,
 
see
 
how
 
many
 
consults
 
you
 
have?
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
showed
 
it
 
to
 
her
 
and
 
she
 
just,
 
she
 
flipped.
 
She
 
was
 
like,
 
I'd
 
never
 
seen
 
this
 
before.
 
So
 
she
 
was
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
would
 
it
 
be
 
possible
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
the
 
head
 
of
 
marketing
 
and
 
then
 
present
 
your
 
idea?
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
did.
 
And
 
actually
 
what
 
he
 
said,
 
which
 
is
 
very
 
promising,
 
and
 
then
 
that's
 
something
 
that,
 
you
 
we
 
can
 
work
 
on.
 
He
 
said
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
guys
 
create
 
this
 
product
 
and
 
then
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
have
 
it
 
ready
 
for
 
lunch,
 
they
 
would
 
cover
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
the
 
implementation
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
few
 
clinics
 
that
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
do,
 
which
 
was
 
really
 
promising.
 
So
 
that,
 
so
 
he,
 
he
 
really
 
liked
 
the
 
idea,
 
but
 
even
 
with
 
that,
 
even
 
with
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
showing
 
them,
 
showing
 
them,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
oh,
 
this
 
many
 
consults,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
that
 
guy
 
told
 
me?
 
That
 
guy
 
told
 
me
 
that
 
your
 
product
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
different,
 
but
 
what
 
if
 
all
 
of
 
this
 
success
 
is
 
you,
 
is
 
me,
 
and
 
you
 
are
 
the
 
one
 
who's
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
generating
 
all
 
these
 
luck,
 
you
 
know,
 
because
 
you're
 
talking,
 
because
 
you're
 
training
 
these
 
people.
 
But
 
what
 
if
 
another
 
psychiatrist
 
is
 
not
 
as
 
motivated?
 
And
 
that
 
made
 
me
 
thinking,
 
what
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
is
 
me
 
and
 
what
 
part
 
of
 
it
 
is
 
actually
 
the
 
marketing
 
aspect,
 
is
 
the
 
product
 
that
 
I
 
created?
 
And
 
I
 
have
 
an
 
understanding.
 
I
 
think
 
like
 
30%
 
of
 
this
 
is
 
me
 
and
 
then
 
about
 
70%
 
is
 
the
 
process.
 
So
 
even
 
if
 
I
 
show
 
this
 
to
 
a
 
very
 
smart
 
psychiatrist,
 
even
 
I
 
say,
 
hey,
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
consults
 
I
 
have.
 
Look
 
at
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
patients
 
I
 
see
 
on
 
a
 
monthly
 
basis.
 
Look
 
at
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
neuromods
 
that
 
I
 
convert.
 
Still
 
then,
 
a
 
good
 
smart
 
psychiatrist
 
would
 
question,
 
okay,
 
it's
 
only
 
one.
 
What
 
if
 
it's
 
only
 
you?
 
What
 
if
 
it's
 
you
 
that's
 
generating
 
all
 
of
 
this
 
thing?
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
your
 
idea
 
is
 
actually
 
a
 
brilliant
 
one,
 
but
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
show
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
it.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
flashy
 
product.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
flashy
 
result.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
be,
 
you
 
know,
 
as
 
I
 
said,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
point.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
point
 
that
 
we
 
are.
 
are
 
not
 
chasing
 
customers.
 
The
 
customers
 
are
 
chasing
 
us.
 
Because
 
the
 
easiest
 
thing,
 
Oriel,
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
few
 
very
 
successful
 
clients,
 
very
 
successful,
 
and
 
then
 
just
 
go
 
have
 
a
 
talk
 
at
 
Brainsway
 
or
 
Spravato
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
they
 
always
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
go
 
and
 
talk.
 
They
 
always
 
ask
 
me,
 
hey,
 
can
 
you
 
come
 
give
 
a
 
talk?
 
I
 
never
 
go.
 
But
 
that's
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
hey,
 
you
 
go
 
and,
 
yes,
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
know,
 
but
 
now
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
marketing
 
company.
 
Can
 
we
 
showcase
 
it?
 
They
 
will
 
be
 
thrilled.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
and
 
say,
 
hey,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
flashy
 
product,
 
and
 
we
 
only
 
take,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
membership.
 
It's
 
not
 
like
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
sell
 
it
 
to
 
everyone.
 
And
 
I
 
can
 
imagine
 
that
 
that's
 
happening
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
 
@43:46

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
get
 
what
 
you're
 
saying.
 
So
 
definitely
 
because,
 
listen,
 
this
 
is,
 
for
 
me,
 
it's
 
obvious
 
that
 
I
 
look
 
at
 
like
 
some
 
sort
 
of
 
a
 
game,
 
even
 
in
 
a
 
sense,
 
because
 
just
 
as
 
a
 
game,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
certain
 
skills
 
and
 
certain
 
tools
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
the
 
final
 
box.
 
Awesome.
 
Beat
 
the
 
final
 
boss.
 
This
 
is
 
for
 
me,
 
the
 
final
 
boss,
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
skills
 
needed
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
marketing
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
You
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
skills
 
needed
 
in
 
building
 
a
 
practice.
 
Combining
 
these
 
two
 
is
 
unbelievable.
 
It
 
can
 
generate
 
unbelievable
 
results.
 
So
 
I
 
see
 
this
 
happening.
 
I
 
see
 
this
 
happening.
 
I
 
can
 
put
 
the
 
dedication
 
inside
 
this.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
project
 
that
 
I
 
want.
 
In
 
my
 
head,
 
and
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
vulnerable
 
with
 
you
 
here,
 
my,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
my
 
dad
 
has
 
passed
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
before
 
he
 
passed,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
huge
 
blow
 
up
 
with
 
my
 
mom,
 
and
 
they
 
divorced.
 
And
 
I
 
lived
 
in
 
my
 
grandma's
 
house
 
for
 
seven,
 
eight
 
months.
 
And
 
basically,
 
the
 
situation
 
right
 
now
 
is
 
that
 
my
 
mom
 
is
 
living
 
from
 
the
 
money
 
that
 
they
 
sold
 
the
 
apartment
 
for.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
my
 
main
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
career
 
ending
 
move
 
in
 
a
 
good
 
way.
 
I
 
want
 
I'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
make
 
so
 
much
 
money
 
that
 
she
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
care
 
about
 
money
 
anymore.
 
Whatever
 
it
 
takes
 
to
 
get
 
there,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
there.
 
If
 
I
 
can
 
be
 
ethical
 
and
 
help
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
process,
 
even
 
better.
 
Even
 
better.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
end,
 
my
 
main
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
do
 
music.
 
That's
 
my
 
main
 
goal.
 
To
 
do
 
music.
 
I
 
do
 
electronic
 
music,
 
Sightrans,
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
a
 
bit
 
about
 
Sightrans.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
produce
 
that
 
and
 
go
 
travel
 
around
 
the
 
world.
 
I
 
actually
 
have
 
a
 
show
 
on
 
Performer
 
next
 
week
 
in
 
a
 
club
 
in
 
Israel.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
my
 
goal.
 
I
 
can
 
definitely
 
see
 
this
 
happening.
 
What
 
you
 
said
 
about
 
within
 
nine
 
months.
 
 
@45:37
 
-
 
Amir
 
And,
 
Oriel,
 
I'm
 
a
 
man
 
of
 
my
 
word.
 
mean,
 
I
 
know,
 
again,
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
me.
 
But
 
I
 
pay
 
my
 
staff
 
well.
 
I'm
 
a
 
fair
 
guy.
 
And
 
what
 
I'm
 
asking
 
and
 
what
 
I'm
 
saying
 
is,
 
I've
 
been
 
where
 
you
 
are.
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
created,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
before
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
medical
 
school.
 
Look,
 
I'm
 
an
 
engineer.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
medical
 
school
 
ten
 
years
 
after.
 
There
 
are...
 
The
 
reason
 
that
 
I
 
graduated
 
in
 
2023
 
at
 
the
 
age
 
of
 
37
 
was
 
because
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
medical
 
school
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
30.
 
So
 
I
 
graduated
 
from
 
electrical
 
engineering
 
in
 
2008.
 
I
 
worked
 
for
 
10
 
years
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
decided
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
medical
 
school.
 
And
 
in
 
this
 
10
 
years,
 
I
 
created
 
so
 
many
 
different
 
businesses.
 
I
 
created
 
a
 
real
 
estate
 
business
 
called
 
Fruity
 
Homes.
 
I
 
created
 
a
 
home
 
renovation
 
business.
 
I
 
created
 
a
 
postal
 
business,
 
but
 
the
 
reason,
 
so
 
what
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you
 
is
 
that
 
I'm
 
just
 
a
 
business-minded
 
person.
 
And
 
then
 
when
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
medical
 
school,
 
I
 
went
 
with
 
the
 
idea
 
of,
 
okay,
 
you
 
know
 
what?
 
As
 
soon
 
as
 
I
 
graduate,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
private
 
practice
 
and
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
explode
 
it.
 
So
 
I
 
understand.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
love.
 
That's
 
what
 
I
 
like.
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
this
 
like
 
hunger
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
make
 
something
 
happen.
 
So
 
I,
 
again,
 
I
 
think
 
based
 
on
 
what
 
I
 
know
 
from
 
you,
 
again,
 
based.
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
level
 
of,
 
again,
 
I
 
haven't
 
seen
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
ads,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
videos,
 
based
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
my
 
talk
 
with
 
you,
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
you've
 
been
 
telling
 
me,
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
can
 
definitely
 
grow
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
resources
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
provide.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
can,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
can,
 
I
 
can
 
build
 
a
 
website
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
pay
 
for
 
it.
 
I
 
can,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
can
 
have
 
everything,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
can
 
create
 
this
 
business
 
without
 
any,
 
anything
 
you
 
put,
 
you
 
putting
 
anything
 
down.
 
You
 
know,
 
we
 
can,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
can
 
pay
 
the
 
guys
 
who,
 
who
 
are
 
the
 
freelancers
 
who
 
can
 
help
 
you.
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
you
 
because
 
that's
 
an
 
investment
 
in
 
you.
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I'm
 
saying,
 
hey,
 
take
 
away
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
profits,
 
that's
 
investment.
 
Not
 
only
 
I'm
 
giving
 
you
 
all
 
the,
 
all
 
the
 
baselines,
 
but
 
also
 
I'm
 
giving
 
you
 
all
 
the,
 
all
 
the,
 
the
 
financial
 
aspect
 
of
 
things.
 
The
 
reason
 
is
 
that,
 
of
 
course,
 
there's
 
a
 
benefit
 
in
 
this
 
for
 
me,
 
because
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
the
 
person
 
that
 
I
 
am
 
looking
 
for,
 
then
 
I'm
 
done.
 
After
 
nine
 
months,
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
we.
 
Have
 
a
 
certain
 
understanding,
 
exactly
 
as
 
you
 
said,
 
I
 
am
 
doing
 
certain
 
things,
 
you
 
are
 
doing
 
certain
 
things,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
clear
 
division
 
of
 
the
 
work
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
for
 
this
 
business,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
business
 
partner
 
with
 
you,
 
but
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
trust
 
you
 
first.
 
 
@48:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense,
 
100%.
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
I'm
 
obviously
 
would
 
be
 
worried
 
about
 
is
 
if
 
after
 
nine
 
months
 
we
 
work,
 
we
 
have
 
10
 
clinics,
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
whole
 
marketing
 
process
 
laid
 
out,
 
I
 
have
 
it
 
all
 
SOP'd,
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
everything,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
will
 
basically,
 
after
 
nine
 
months,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
understand
 
my
 
mind,
 
you
 
would
 
know
 
how
 
my
 
mind
 
works.
 
At
 
that
 
point,
 
you
 
can
 
definitely
 
bring
 
someone
 
who
 
is
 
under,
 
like
 
a
 
beat
 
player,
 
and
 
take
 
all
 
the
 
profits
 
for
 
yourself,
 
and
 
let
 
the
 
beat
 
player
 
do
 
the
 
work,
 
and
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
be
 
with
 
the
 
clinics,
 
or
 
hire
 
a
 
customer
 
service
 
rep,
 
and
 
a
 
customer
 
success
 
rep,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So,
 
the
 
question
 
is...
 
How
 
can
 
I,
 
you
 
how
 
can
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
if
 
I,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
the,
 
that's
 
the
 
thing.
 
 
@49:07
 
-
 
Amir
 
This
 
is
 
the,
 
yeah,
 
you
 
just
 
have
 
my
 
word.
 
 
@49:15
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Difficult
 
stuff.
 
 
@49:16
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
know,
 
but
 
unfortunately,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's
 
no,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
thought
 
about
 
the
 
legality
 
of
 
it.
 
Like,
 
oh,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
do
 
you,
 
like,
 
you're
 
not
 
a
 
U.S.
 
 
@49:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
citizen,
 
right?
 
 
@49:25
 
-
 
Amir
 
No.
 
No.
 
Do
 
you
 
have,
 
have
 
you,
 
have
 
you
 
been
 
here
 
before?
 
 
@49:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
In
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
yes,
 
I
 
have
 
been.
 
 
@49:30
 
-
 
Amir
 
Okay,
 
I,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
how
 
ownership
 
of
 
a
 
company
 
works
 
for
 
a
 
foreign,
 
uh,
 
foreign
 
person,
 
so
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
look
 
into
 
that,
 
but,
 
uh,
 
but,
 
however
 
I
 
thought
 
about
 
the
 
legality
 
of
 
it,
 
it,
 
it
 
just
 
doesn't,
 
like,
 
I
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
word
 
it,
 
because
 
I've
 
worded
 
many
 
documents,
 
many
 
contracts,
 
um,
 
it,
 
you
 
know,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
would
 
say,
 
if
 
I
 
decide
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
this
 
person
 
in
 
nine
 
months,
 
then
 
he's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
having
 
50%
 
ownership
 
of
 
the
 
company.
 
But
 
what
 
if
 
I
 
don't
 
decide
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
this
 
person?
 
So
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
day,
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
say,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
you,
 
but
 
what
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
is
 
that
 
if
 
this,
 
if,
 
I
 
mean,
 
not
 
10
 
clinics,
 
let's
 
say
 
two
 
clinics,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
two
 
clinics
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
nine
 
months,
 
and
 
they
 
are,
 
and
 
they're
 
working
 
well,
 
and
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
disagreements,
 
and
 
we're
 
working
 
well
 
together,
 
and
 
again,
 
I
 
am
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
telling
 
you,
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
work
 
with
 
me
 
for
 
a
 
month,
 
if
 
you,
 
if
 
you
 
feel
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
too
 
bossy,
 
or
 
I'm
 
just
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
trying
 
to
 
push
 
my
 
agenda,
 
leave.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
feel
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
nine
 
months,
 
if
 
you
 
feel
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
we're
 
working
 
together,
 
we're
 
working
 
well,
 
you
 
have
 
my
 
word,
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
company,
 
we
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
like,
 
know,
 
look
 
at
 
what,
 
what
 
is
 
the,
 
like,
 
like,
 
what
 
do
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the,
 
the,
 
the
 
legal
 
aspect
 
of
 
things.
 
 
@50:46

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@50:47
 
-
 
Amir
 
It's
 
very
 
difficult,
 
it's
 
very
 
difficult
 
to
 
take
 
somebody's
 
word
 
these
 
days.
 
I'm
 
a
 
man
 
of
 
my
 
words.
 
 
@50:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
Cool.
 
Cool.
 
Okay,
 
so,
 
it's
 
the.
 
Is
 
there
 
something
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over?
 
How
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
this
 
morning?
 
 
@51:10
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
is,
 
first,
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
just
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
documents
 
that
 
you
 
sent
 
me.
 
If
 
you
 
don't
 
mind,
 
please
 
send
 
me
 
a
 
scale.
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
already
 
or
 
not,
 
but
 
send
 
me
 
a
 
scale
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
your...
 
Expertise,
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
your
 
expertise
 
in
 
all
 
of
 
those
 
tools
 
that
 
we're
 
using.
 
And
 
if
 
you're
 
not
 
familiar
 
with
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
tools,
 
just
 
look
 
it
 
up
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
it
 
is,
 
and
 
then
 
tell
 
me
 
if
 
you're
 
using
 
an
 
alternative,
 
and
 
then
 
what
 
that
 
alternative
 
is.
 
 
@51:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
that's
 
okay.
 
I
 
mean,
 
we
 
just
 
picked
 
these
 
tools
 
because
 
I
 
picked
 
them.
 
 
@51:50
 
-
 
Amir
 
And
 
then
 
let's
 
have
 
a
 
meeting,
 
so
 
with
 
the
 
two
 
freelancers
 
that
 
I'm
 
working
 
with,
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
starting
 
to
 
introduce
 
you
 
to
 
the
 
whole
 
idea
 
of
 
what
 
we're
 
doing.
 
And
 
then
 
we'll
 
go
 
from
 
there,
 
but
 
still
 
there's
 
a
 
remaining
 
problem,
 
what
 
are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
Greenbrook's?

So
 
currently
 
with
 
Greenbrook,
 
until
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
base
 
here,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
leave
 
Greenbrook,
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
happen.
 
They're
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
client
 
and
 
they're
 
very
 
nice
 
people,
 
like
 
the
 
people
 
I'm
 
working
 
with
 
and
 
talking
 
with,
 
they're
 
very
 
nice
 
people.
 
Really?
 
They
 
are?
 
 
@52:31
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah,
 
yeah.
 
 
@52:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
once
 
I
 
see
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
base,
 
we
 
could
 
do
 
one
 
of
 
two
 
things.
 
One,
 
I
 
may
 
need
 
to
 
stop
 
working
 
with
 
them,
 
depending
 
on
 
what
 
we
 
build.
 
Because
 
you
 
see,
 
if
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
me
 
an
 
X
 
amount
 
of
 
money,
 
which
 
is
 
$10,000
 
to
 
$15,000
 
a
 
month
 
for
 
me
 
consulting
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
cool.
 
But
 
if
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
better
 
product
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
it's
 
mine,
 
it
 
is
 
what
 
it
 
is.
 
Sometimes
 
So
 
that's
 
one
 
thing.
 
Or
 
the
 
other
 
thing
 
could
 
be
 
any
 
ads
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
write
 
or
 
work
 
on
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
exclusive
 
ads
 
for
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
we
 
work
 
with.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
another
 
thing,
 
like
 
you
 
said,
 
have
 
my
 
word,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
my
 
word,
 
that
 
the
 
ads
 
that
 
I
 
write,
 
you
 
know,
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
ours
 
and
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
to
 
distribute
 
to
 
any
 
other
 
client.
 
And
 
in
 
general,
 
with
 
Greenbrook
 
themselves,
 
the
 
main
 
focus
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
with
 
their
 
ads
 
is
 
testimonial-based
 
ads.
 
I'm
 
not
 
doing
 
the
 
regular
 
type
 
of
 
ads.
 
Even
 
though
 
they
 
work,
 
but
 
they
 
have
 
such
 
great
 
testimonials
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
create
 
just
 
unbelievable
 
stories
 
from
 
them,
 
and
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
ads
 
that
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
crush
 
it.
 
 
@53:38
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
just
 
know.
 
I
 
watched
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
testimonials,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
they're
 
mainly
 
African-Americans.
 
Did
 
you
 
guys,
 
you
 
know,
 
pick,
 
you
 
are
 
running
 
those?
 
 
@53:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
these
 
new
 
ads,
 
these
 
ads
 
that
 
they're
 
running
 
right
 
now,
 
they're
 
not
 
mine.
 
They
 
are
 
still
 
in
 
production
 
for
 
my
 
ads.
 
There's
 
like
 
40
 
variations
 
that
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
produce
 
based
 
on
 
my
 
ads.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
stuff.
 
 
@54:03
 
-
 
Amir
 
But
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
they're
 
running
 
right
 
now,
 
because
 
they
 
obviously
 
come
 
up
 
on
 
my
 
feed,
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
they're
 
actors.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
like
 
Junior.
 
 
@54:13
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
There
 
are
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
actors,
 
from
 
what
 
I
 
understood.
 
I
 
don't.
 
Yes,
 
yes,
 
yes.
 
People
 
are
 
actors.
 
There
 
may
 
be
 
people,
 
if
 
I'm
 
not
 
mistaken,
 
people
 
that
 
talk
 
in
 
the
 
testimonial.
 
There's
 
this
 
guy
 
called
 
Jay,
 
which
 
he's
 
not
 
an
 
actor.
 
He's
 
actually
 
a
 
person.
 
 
@54:28
 
-
 
Amir
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
who
 
that
 
guy
 
is.
 
Is
 
the
 
guy
 
with
 
the
 
red
 
hair?
 
 
@54:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
it's
 
a,
 
he,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
explain
 
him
 
even.
 
He's
 
like
 
brownish,
 
he
 
has
 
glasses,
 
and
 
he
 
talks
 
about
 
what
 
he,
 
what
 
TMS
 
did
 
to
 
him
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
helped
 
him.
 
He
 
has
 
like
 
a,
 
he
 
has
 
a,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
like
 
a
 
spiky
 
hair,
 
if
 
I
 
remember
 
correctly.
 
So
 
there's
 
that.
 
And
 
there's
 
also
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
UGC
 
creators
 
as
 
well.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
and
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
the
 
UGC
 
creators
 
is
 
have
 
them
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
stories.
 
of
 
the
 
real
 
patients
 
and
 
not
 
place
 
them
 
as.
 
People
 
that
 
have
 
done
 
something
 
specific
 
because
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
that's
 
the
 
thing,
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
these
 
are
 
not
 
genuine
 
people.
 
You
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
the
 
energy
 
in
 
which,
 
in
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
they're
 
talking,
 
they're
 
talking
 
like
 
they're
 
selling
 
an
 
e-commerce
 
product.
 
And
 
it's
 
not,
 
there's
 
a
 
specific
 
tone
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be,
 
you
 
know,
 
used
 
in
 
ads.
 
And
 
once
 
you
 
find
 
the
 
right
 
tone
 
and
 
you
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
the
 
clients
 
and
 
the
 
patients
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
way,
 
and
 
you
 
understand
 
where
 
they're
 
at,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
also,
 
you
 
know,
 
communicate
 
to
 
them
 
how
 
you
 
can
 
solve
 
their
 
problems
 
and
 
create
 
the
 
belief
 
in
 
them,
 
problem
 
is
 
basically
 
solved.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
this
 
part,
 
generate
 
a
 
ton
 
of
 
demand,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
got
 
people
 
to
 
the
 
clinic
 
and
 
stuff,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
know
 
that.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
do
 
there.
 
And
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
whole
 
call
 
center
 
and
 
they,
 
they're,
 
they're,
 
they
 
have
 
so
 
many
 
calls
 
going
 
out
 
every
 
single
 
day.
 
Like
 
absolute
 
insanity.
 
What's
 
going
 
on
 
there?
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
like,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
share,
 
what's
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
right
 
now?
 
 
@55:57
 
-
 
Amir
 
if
 
you,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
average
 
of
 
it.
 
 
@55:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
 
@56:03
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
haven't
 
calculated
 
it
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
again,
 
it's
 
dynamic,
 
it's
 
a
 
change.
 
 
@56:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about
 
like,
 
because
 
here's
 
another
 
thing,
 
which
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
helpful
 
with.
 
Do
 
you
 
know,
 
are
 
you
 
using,
 
because
 
you
 
just
 
talked
 
about
 
Google
 
Analytics,
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
that
 
you're
 
using
 
UTMs,
 
right?
 
 
@56:20
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yes.
 
 
@56:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
with
 
the
 
UTMs
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
process
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
know
 
exactly
 
which
 
person
 
has
 
been
 
closed
 
from
 
what
 
ad.
 
And
 
once
 
this
 
person
 
is
 
closed,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
send
 
the
 
data
 
back
 
to
 
Facebook.
 
So
 
Facebook
 
optimizes
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
purchases
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
starting
 
treatment
 
from
 
the
 
ad
 
and
 
not
 
just
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
lead
 
cost,
 
because
 
that's
 
misleading.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
that's
 
another
 
thing
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
understand
 
because
 
Facebook
 
can
 
be
 
very,
 
if
 
you
 
hop
 
on
 
now
 
and
 
tell
 
me,
 
Oriel,
 
look,
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
and
 
this
 
and
 
this
 
ad.
 
This
 
ad
 
has
 
generated
 
X
 
amount,
 
like
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
cost
 
per
 
lead.
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
accurate.
 
If
 
you're
 
losing
 
that
 
landing
 
pages,
 
least.
 
And
 
also,
 
not
 
only
 
that.
 
It's
 
not
 
accurate.
 
On
 
a
 
bigger
 
scale,
 
and
 
what
 
you're
 
running
 
at
 
right
 
now,
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
which
 
person
 
comes
 
from
 
which
 
ad.
 
You
 
just
 
know
 
that
 
the
 
campaign
 
works,
 
okay?
 
And
 
when
 
you
 
scale,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
foundations
 
placed
 
to
 
understand
 
what
 
ads,
 
what's
 
the
 
messaging
 
that
 
works,
 
you
 
know,
 
expand
 
on
 
that.
 
 
@57:18
 
-
 
Amir
 
So...
 
We
 
are
 
using
 
that.
 
 
@57:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
idea?
 
 
@57:23
 
-
 
Amir
 
It's
 
not
 
optimized
 
because
 
I
 
tell
 
these
 
guys,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
do
 
this,
 
and
 
then
 
do
 
that,
 
and
 
then
 
do
 
this,
 
and
 
then
 
do
 
that,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
focused,
 
but
 
we
 
are
 
using
 
it.
 
mean,
 
like,
 
in
 
every
 
single
 
consult,
 
we
 
know
 
exactly
 
from
 
what
 
ad
 
it's
 
coming
 
from.
 
 
@57:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Okay.
 
 
@57:42
 
-
 
Amir
 
That's
 
cool.
 
But
 
obviously,
 
like,
 
it
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
optimized.
 
 
@57:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
So,
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
your
 
average
 
cost
 
per
 
lead?
 
Because
 
that's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
interested
 
in.
 
There's
 
nothing
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
with
 
this
 
data
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@57:53
 
-
 
Amir
 
It's
 
about
 
$200.
 
 
@57:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Per
 
lead
 
or
 
per
 
consult?
 
 
@57:57
 
-
 
Amir
 
Per
 
patient
 
on
 
chair.
 
 
@57:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
a
 
very,
 
that's
 
a
 
good
 
CPA.
 
 
@58:01
 
-
 
Amir
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
a
 
metric
 
that
 
I
 
only
 
go
 
with.
 
I
 
don't
 
go
 
with
 
any
 
of
 
anything
 
else.
 
How
 
many
 
patients
 
are
 
sitting
 
on
 
the
 
chair
 
getting
 
treatment?
 
 
@58:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
a
 
good
 
CPA.
 
That's
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
CPA.
 
Okay.
 
 
@58:20
 
-
 
Amir
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
So
 
let
 
me
 
think
 
about
 
it
 
a
 
little
 
bit.
 
So
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
things.
 
So
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
called
 
it
 
Bright
 
Horizons
 
Marketing,
 
obviously,
 
because
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
be
 
associated
 
with
 
Bright
 
Bright
 
Horizons,
 
Psychiatry.
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
guy
 
started
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
website.
 
 
@58:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
the
 
website
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
10
 
days.
 
 
@58:41
 
-
 
Amir
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
talk
 
about,
 
we
 
can
 
think
 
about,
 
what
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
specific
 
to,
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
structure
 
that
 
I'm
 
using
 
and
 
all
 
the
 
tools
 
and
 
everything
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
using
 
for
 
our
 
ads.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
obviously
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
what,
 
what
 
I'm
 
asking
 
these
 
guys
 
to
 
do,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
help
 
a
 
lot
 
with
 
this
 
is,
 
I
 
want
 
them
 
to
 
up.
 
Optimize
 
the
 
tools
 
like
 
the
 
GoHighLevel
 
and
 
the
 
tracking
 
and
 
all
 
the
 
landing
 
pages
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
come
 
in,
 
you
 
can
 
work
 
with
 
them
 
very
 
closely
 
to
 
get
 
this
 
to
 
a
 
part,
 
to
 
a
 
point
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
easily
 
duplicate
 
it.
 
When
 
we
 
can
 
easily
 
duplicate
 
it,
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
base
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
start
 
going
 
and
 
looking
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
customer.
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
share
 
with
 
you
 
what
 
I
 
said
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
say.
 
So
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
it,
 
Oriel,
 
is
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
talking
 
to
 
the
 
sales
 
rep
 
for
 
Spravato
 
and
 
TMS.
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
asking
 
them
 
to
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
person,
 
psychiatrist
 
who
 
has
 
the
 
stamina
 
and
 
the
 
energy,
 
but
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
knowledge
 
of
 
like,
 
how
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
getting
 
the
 
patients?
 
So
 
somebody
 
who
 
is
 
a
 
go-getter,
 
but
 
does
 
not
 
and
 
have
 
a
 
TMS
 
machine
 
and
 
only
 
sees
 
like
 
three
 
patients
 
a
 
day.
 
So
 
we
 
need
 
that.
 
need
 
that.
 
We
 
need
 
somebody
 
who
 
is
 
willing
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
work
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
enough
 
patience,
 
and
 
then
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
target
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
after
 
we
 
target
 
that,
 
Oriel,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
quick
 
call
 
with
 
them,
 
introduce
 
myself,
 
obviously
 
it's
 
going
 
be
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
them.
 
And
 
then
 
me
 
and
 
you,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
pick
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
companies,
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
clinics,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
everything
 
for
 
free
 
for
 
them.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
this,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
everything.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
tell
 
them,
 
like,
 
we
 
just
 
do
 
it.
 
If
 
you
 
start
 
seeing
 
results,
 
pay
 
us
 
later.
 
I
 
know
 
you're
 
doing
 
that.
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
mentioned
 
that
 
in
 
one
 
of
 
your
 
things.
 
However,
 
it
 
has
 
to
 
be,
 
so
 
you
 
said,
 
so
 
I
 
think,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
you
 
mentioned
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
would
 
charge
 
them
 
per
 
lead
 
or
 
per
 
consult,
 
per
 
booked
 
consult
 
as
 
well.
 
Yeah.
 
I
 
say,
 
because
 
it's
 
very
 
difficult
 
because
 
when
 
you're
 
running
 
ads,
 
Google
 
ads,
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
do
 
have
 
some
 
conversions
 
from
 
your
 
go
 
high
 
level,
 
but
 
you
 
know,
 
there
 
are
 
some
 
conversions.
 
We
 
get
 
phone
 
calls
 
like,
 
hey,
 
I
 
saw
 
you
 
on
 
Google.
 
Hey,
 
I
 
saw
 
you
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
Those
 
are
 
leads
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
generating.
 
So
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
with
 
that.
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
with
 
the
 
number.
 
So
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
converted
 
patients
 
on
 
chair.
 
They
 
have.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
them
 
that
 
if
 
we
 
start
 
increasing
 
this
 
number,
 
then
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
paying
 
us
 
$5,000
 
a
 
month.
 
 
@1:01:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
fixed
 
cost.
 
 
@1:01:25
 
-
 
Amir
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
introduce
 
our
 
company.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
some
 
free
 
work.
 
And
 
then
 
after
 
three
 
or
 
four
 
companies,
 
and
 
after
 
we
 
have
 
generated
 
that
 
amount
 
of
 
stamina,
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
just
 
say,
 
okay,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
now
 
we're
 
just
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
pay
 
the
 
base,
 
you
 
know,
 
for
 
everything
 
that
 
we
 
create
 
from
 
the
 
get
 
go
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
jazz.
 
 
@1:01:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
That
 
sounds
 
good.
 
Uh,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion,
 
if
 
you,
 
if
 
you
 
even
 
want
 
to
 
work,
 
have
 
a
 
only
 
result
 
based
 
thing.
 
So
 
the
 
first
 
one
 
to
 
two
 
months
 
only
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
pay
 
per
 
patient
 
that
 
comes
 
on
 
chair.
 
So
 
if
 
a
 
patient
 
is
 
closed
 
on
 
a
 
X,
 
uh,
 
on
 
a.
 
So
 
$3,000
 
ketamine
 
treatment
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that,
 
we
 
can
 
take
 
a
 
percentage
 
out
 
of
 
that
 
instead
 
of
 
charging
 
them
 
fixed
 
cost
 
and
 
then
 
transition
 
to
 
the
 
fixed
 
cost.
 
 
@1:02:12
 
-
 
Amir
 
I'm
 
okay
 
with
 
that.
 
The
 
only
 
problem
 
with
 
that
 
is,
 
again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
not
 
all
 
patients
 
are
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
conversions,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
patients
 
are
 
coming
 
from
 
like
 
everywhere
 
and
 
then
 
they're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
truthful
 
about
 
that.
 
They're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
and
 
see
 
how
 
many
 
patients
 
we
 
have
 
and
 
what
 
four
 
patients
 
from
 
go
 
high
 
level.
 
And
 
that's
 
not
 
what
 
happens.
 
I
 
mean,
 
what
 
happens
 
is
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
your
 
numbers
 
go
 
up
 
because
 
everything
 
goes
 
up.
 
SEO,
 
Google
 
presence,
 
Google
 
business
 
profile,
 
it's
 
everything.
 
So,
 
so
 
yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
can
 
talk
 
about
 
it,
 
but
 
that's,
 
but
 
that's
 
how
 
I'm
 
imagining,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
getting
 
the
 
first
 
few
 
companies
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
just
 
hook
 
them,
 
we
 
just
 
do
 
everything.
 
As
 
soon
 
as
 
you
 
start
 
generating.
 
know,
 
you
 
know,
 
know,
 
I'll
 
time.
 
So
 
or
 
patients,
 
then
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
start
 
paying
 
us,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
talk
 
about,
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
find
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
can,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
we
 
can
 
average
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
neuromods
 
they
 
had
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
let's
 
say
 
six
 
months,
 
and
 
then
 
whatever
 
number
 
we
 
go
 
above
 
that,
 
they
 
have
 
to
 
pay
 
us
 
like
 
$1,000
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
 
@1:03:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
yeah.
 
 
@1:03:22
 
-
 
Amir
 
There
 
are
 
multiple
 
ways
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
it.
 
 
@1:03:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that
 
sounds
 
cool.
 
So,
 
next
 
steps
 
for
 
now,
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
about
 
the
 
tools
 
and
 
my
 
familiarity
 
with
 
them?
 
No
 
problem.
 
What
 
do
 
I,
 
is
 
there
 
anything
 
that
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
expect
 
from
 
you,
 
or,
 
like,
 
what
 
is
 
there?
 
Because,
 
honestly,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
like,
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
those
 
Spravato
 
reps?
 
Because
 
I
 
understand
 
how
 
this
 
works.
 
It's
 
a
 
very
 
simple
 
process,
 
actually.
 
We're
 
having
 
this,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
pilot
 
for
 
me,
 
basically.
 
You
 
want,
 
you
 
go
 
talk
 
to
 
the
 
sales
 
reps
 
of
 
Spravato,
 
or
 
whoever
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
in
 
Brinsway,
 
or
 
whoever
 
that
 
is.
 
Get
 
the
 
companies.
 
Get
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
do.
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
help
 
them.
 
and
 
this
 
is...
 
This
 
 
@1:05:02
 
-
 
Amir
 
Differences.
 
Which
 
one
 
is
 
working
 
better?
 
Whatever
 
is
 
working
 
better,
 
we
 
implement
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
create
 
the
 
Bright
 
Horizon
 
Psychiatry
 
System
 
flawless.
 
And
 
then
 
after
 
this
 
is
 
flawless,
 
then
 
we
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
so
 
easily
 
duplicatable.
 
Like,
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
copy
 
and
 
paste
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
event.
 
And
 
I'm
 
to
 
need
 
your
 
help
 
with
 
that.
 
 
@1:05:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
100%.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that,
 
like,
 
another
 
thing
 
that,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
where
 
AI
 
really
 
comes
 
into
 
play,
 
for
 
example,
 
when
 
people,
 
this
 
is
 
just
 
one
 
idea
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand.
 
When
 
people
 
submit
 
an
 
onboarding
 
form,
 
what
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
is
 
that
 
it
 
can
 
send
 
a
 
webhook
 
to
 
this
 
tool
 
called
 
Base44,
 
which
 
all
 
it
 
does
 
is
 
create
 
landing
 
pages.
 
You
 
can
 
set
 
it
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
a
 
specific
 
project,
 
duplicate
 
that
 
project,
 
and
 
replace
 
the
 
placeholders
 
with
 
what
 
they
 
submitted
 
in
 
the
 
onboarding
 
form.
 
So
 
that
 
duplicates
 
the
 
landing
 
page.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
then
 
use
 
this
 
landing
 
page,
 
create
 
a
 
subdomain
 
for
 
it,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
clinic
 
itself.
 
And
 
just
 
use
 
it
 
for
 
the
 
ads,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
ready.
 
I've...
 
Everything's
 
got
 
to
 
be
 
ready
 
automatically
 
within,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
minutes,
 
because
 
Base44
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
everything,
 
the
 
automation
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
everything,
 
so
 
it's
 
just
 
one
 
idea.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
the
 
duplication
 
part
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
fairly
 
simple,
 
I
 
believe.
 
Obviously
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
need,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
run
 
into
 
challenges,
 
but
 
because
 
of
 
AI,
 
AI
 
is
 
just
 
unbelievable.
 
 
@1:06:23
 
-
 
Amir
 
Are
 
you
 
doing
 
all
 
the
 
technical
 
parts
 
yourself,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
people
 
do
 
that
 
for
 
you?
 
 
@1:06:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
currently
 
with
 
the
 
U.S.
 
market,
 
I'm
 
doing
 
all
 
the
 
technical
 
parts
 
on
 
my
 
own,
 
it's
 
way
 
easier.
 
Instead
 
of
 
paying
 
somebody
 
an
 
X
 
amount
 
of
 
money
 
a
 
month
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
hire
 
what's
 
called
 
a
 
black
 
hat
 
virtual
 
assistant,
 
which
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
training
 
on,
 
doing
 
the
 
onboarding
 
things,
 
all
 
the
 
technical
 
things
 
which
 
are
 
low
 
leverage,
 
so
 
I
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
high
 
leverage
 
things,
 
which,
 
you
 
know,
 
creating
 
the
 
ads,
 
doing
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
 
@1:06:49
 
-
 
Amir
 
But
 
are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
pause
 
that
 
for
 
now?
 
 
@1:06:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
100%.
 
So,
 
Oriel,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
this,
 
okay?
 
Mm-hmm.
 
 
@1:06:59
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
So
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to...
 
Again,
 
so
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
guys.
 
They're
 
technical.
 
I
 
think
 
they
 
know.
 
Again,
 
you
 
know,
 
when
 
you're
 
going
 
to,
 
like,
 
webhooks
 
and
 
stuff,
 
that's
 
beyond
 
me.
 
I
 
don't
 
understand
 
that.
 
I
 
know
 
when
 
they
 
talk,
 
they
 
use
 
that,
 
like,
 
webhooks.
 
But
 
let's
 
have
 
a
 
meeting
 
with
 
Danish
 
and
 
Sagar.
 
And
 
let
 
us
 
explain
 
to
 
you
 
what
 
we're
 
doing.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
simple
 
thing.
 
Like,
 
you
 
we
 
have
 
ads,
 
landing
 
page,
 
go
 
high
 
level,
 
and
 
then
 
conversion,
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
bot
 
kicks
 
in.
 
So,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
access
 
to
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
tell
 
me,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
what's
 
working,
 
what's
 
not
 
working.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you,
 
like,
 
you
 
our
 
ads
 
are
 
a
 
mess,
 
because
 
I'm
 
working,
 
I'm
 
doing
 
them.
 
I
 
am
 
just,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
generating,
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
retarget
 
and
 
stuff
 
like
 
that.
 
 
@1:07:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
definitely
 
use
 
your
 
help
 
on
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
 
@1:07:54
 
-
 
Amir
 
Sounds
 
good?
 
 
@1:07:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
sounds
 
good.
 
So,
 
okay.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
an
 
email
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
tools
 
and
 
the
 
knowledge
 
about
 
the
 
tools.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
me
 
an
 
update
 
with
 
when
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
happen.
 
We'll
 
with
 
the
 
guys
 
or
 
anything
 
else,
 
and
 
we'll
 
just
 
go
 
from
 
there.
 
 
@1:08:06
 
-
 
Amir
 
Sounds
 
good.
 
And
 
what
 
time
 
is
 
it
 
there
 
right
 
now?
 
 
@1:08:10
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
currently
 
5.12
 
p.m.
 
Okay.
 
 
@1:08:16
 
-
 
Amir
 
All
 
right.
 
And
 
what
 
time
 
do
 
you
 
usually
 
work?
 
From
 
what
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
morning
 
to
 
what
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
evening?
 
 
@1:08:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I
 
work
 
usually,
 
I
 
decide
 
when
 
to
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
mornings,
 
usually
 
from
 
10.
 
And
 
10
 
in
 
the
 
morning
 
until
 
12,
 
I
 
give
 
myself
 
some
 
time
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
doing
 
stuff
 
for
 
myself.
 
So
 
if
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
for
 
us,
 
would
 
be
 
refining
 
things
 
in
 
the
 
company
 
itself
 
with
 
what
 
we
 
do.
 
And
 
then
 
from
 
12
 
to
 
X,
 
Y,
 
Z,
 
I'm
 
working.
 
It
 
depends.
 
I
 
can
 
stop
 
working
 
whenever
 
I
 
want.
 
It
 
could
 
be
 
6,
 
7,
 
8.
 
It
 
really
 
depends
 
on
 
my
 
energy
 
and
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do.
 
But
 
usually
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
work
 
later
 
than
 
8.
 
I
 
try
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
hard
 
stop
 
there
 
because
 
it's
 
a
 
lot
 
for
 
me.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@1:08:59
 
-
 
Amir
 
Absolutely.
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
five
 
hours.
 
Or
 
is
 
that
 
going
 
to
 
put
 
me
 
at
 
4
 
a.m.?
 
So
 
4
 
a.m.
 
is
 
12
 
p.m.
 
your
 
time.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
8
 
would
 
be
 
around...
 
 
@1:09:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
p.m.
 
for
 
you.
 
 
@1:09:14
 
-
 
Amir
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
Okay.
 
Sounds
 
good.
 
 
@1:09:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
we'll
 
be
 
in
 
touch,
 
Oriel.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
went
 
in
 
for
 
you.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
email.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
video,
 
though,
 
with
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
everything.
 
Okay.
 
Awesome.
 
Talk

Amir
 
So
 
I
 
just,
 
I
 
know,
 
like,
 
you
 
you're
 
probably
 
wondering,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
how
 
this
 
guy,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
sent
 
me
 
a
 
text,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
is
 
he
 
talking
 
about?
 
 
@0:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
where
 
you
 
came
 
from.
 
 
@0:22
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
where
 
you
 
came
 
from.
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
cut
 
to
 
the
 
chase.
 
So
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
call
 
is,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
big
 
picture
 
is
 
I
 
worked
 
with
 
two
 
of
 
the
 
biggest
 
companies,
 
the
 
marketing
 
companies
 
in
 
TMS
 
and
 
S
 
Academy.
 
I
 
worked
 
with
 
Beyond
 
Marketing
 
and
 
then
 
with
 
whatever,
 
something
 
for
 
TMS,
 
app
 
for
 
TMS,
 
whatever
 
they
 
are.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
premium,
 
top,
 
they
 
sucked.
 
And
 
what
 
happened
 
was
 
I,
 
about
 
eight
 
months
 
ago,
 
I
 
decided
 
that
 
I
 
am
 
going
 
to
 
train
 
myself
 
in
 
marketing
 
and
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
bring
 
everything
 
in
 
house
 
and
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
start.
 
 
@0:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
So
 
I
 
brought
 
everything.
 
 
@1:04
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
basically
 
taught
 
myself
 
everything
 
about
 
marketing,
 
about
 
SEO,
 
about
 
campaigns,
 
Meta,
 
Google,
 
everything.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
hired
 
two
 
freelancers
 
in
 
India
 
and
 
Pakistan
 
to
 
basically
 
just
 
implement
 
what
 
I
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
for
 
the
 
past
 
few
 
months,
 
and
 
it's
 
working
 
beautifully.
 
Now,
 
it
 
came
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
sparked
 
in
 
my
 
mind,
 
and
 
again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
running
 
a
 
thriving
 
business
 
here,
 
and
 
then
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
just
 
got
 
this
 
marketing.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
why
 
not?
 
I
 
start
 
a
 
marketing
 
company.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
product
 
out
 
there,
 
which
 
are
 
claiming
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
best.
 
It
 
sucks.
 
So
 
why
 
not,
 
now
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
do,
 
why
 
not
 
to
 
bring
 
it
 
out.
 
Now,
 
one
 
obstacle
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
is
 
that
 
I
 
am,
 
you
 
know,
 
my
 
practice
 
sees
 
about
 
60
 
to
 
70
 
patients
 
a
 
day.
 
And
 
I
 
work
 
with
 
three
 
nurse
 
practitioners,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
a
 
very
 
highly
 
dynamic,
 
fast-paced
 
office.
 
And
 
me,
 
getting
 
myself
 
into
 
marketing,
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
spend
 
a
 
good
 
chunk
 
of
 
time,
 
a
 
good
 
three,
 
four
 
months.
 
I
 
really,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
10,
 
12-hour
 
days,
 
I
 
trained
 
myself,
 
basically.
 
Starting
 
a
 
marketing
 
business
 
is
 
a
 
different
 
animal.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
require
 
a
 
dedicated
 
amount
 
of
 
time,
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
me
 
starting,
 
like,
 
this
 
practice
 
is
 
my
 
fourth
 
business.
 
And
 
I
 
know,
 
one
 
thing
 
I
 
know
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
cannot
 
half-
 
something.
 
You
 
have
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
put
 
all
 
your
 
dedication
 
and
 
focus
 
on
 
that
 
business.
 
When
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
ad,
 
something
 
came
 
to
 
my
 
mind.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
was
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
videos
 
that
 
you
 
were
 
creating.
 
I
 
looked
 
at
 
your
 
website,
 
and
 
I,
 
and
 
again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
introducing
 
myself.
 
 
@2:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
 
@3:00
 
-
 
Amir
 
So
 
when
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
ad,
 
was
 
like,
 
okay,
 
so
 
you
 
know
 
what?
 
There's
 
this
 
guy
 
who
 
does
 
neuromodulation
 
marketing.
 
It
 
seemed
 
to
 
me,
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
the
 
marketing
 
and
 
the
 
website
 
that
 
you
 
have,
 
that,
 
and
 
again,
 
correct
 
me
 
if
 
I'm
 
wrong,
 
that
 
was
 
my
 
assumption.
 
That
 
you
 
are
 
a
 
very
 
small
 
operation.
 
That's
 
correct.
 
And
 
it
 
seemed
 
to
 
me
 
that
 
you
 
might
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
funds
 
to
 
implement
 
the
 
things,
 
the
 
ideas
 
that
 
you
 
have.
 
So,
 
again,
 
like
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
let
 
you
 
introduce
 
yourself
 
and
 
let
 
me,
 
but
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
thinking
 
is
 
that,
 
how
 
about,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I,
 
because
 
the,
 
like,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
thinking.
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
let
 
me
 
just
 
hire
 
somebody,
 
train
 
them,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
from,
 
from
 
the
 
get
 
go.
 
And
 
then,
 
and,
 
and,
 
and.
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
no,
 
neuromodulation
 
marketing
 
is
 
very
 
specific.
 
I
 
need
 
somebody
 
who
 
knows
 
neuromodulation.
 
I
 
cannot,
 
like,
 
train
 
somebody
 
from
 
zero
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
marketer
 
in
 
neuromodulation.
 
So
 
I
 
thought,
 
how
 
about,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
this
 
guy
 
who
 
wants
 
to
 
do
 
marketing,
 
has
 
a
 
marketing
 
business.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can
 
bring
 
this
 
aspect.
 
I
 
can
 
bring,
 
you
 
know,
 
I,
 
so
 
obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
know
 
many
 
psychiatrists
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
putting
 
a
 
face
 
of
 
a
 
psychiatrist
 
on
 
a
 
marketing
 
product
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
you
 
want
 
a
 
second?
 
 
@4:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What's
 
up?
 
 
@4:34
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah.
 
No.
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
good.
 
Um,
 
so,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
finances,
 
I
 
can,
 
I
 
can
 
provide,
 
um,
 
marketing
 
in
 
terms
 
of,
 
like,
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
the,
 
face
 
of
 
the
 
company
 
toward
 
psychiatrists,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
like,
 
picking
 
up
 
the
 
phone
 
and
 
saying,
 
Hey,
 
hey,
 
John,
 
I've
 
been
 
doing
 
this
 
myself.
 
Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
this
 
is,
 
this
 
is
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
happen,
 
but
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
need.
 
Somebody
 
who
 
knows
 
neuromodulation
 
marketing
 
and
 
who
 
can
 
work
 
with
 
these
 
freelancers
 
in
 
India
 
and
 
Pakistan
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
operations.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
came
 
to
 
my
 
mind
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
looking
 
at
 
your
 
ads
 
and
 
looking
 
at
 
your
 
website.
 
Now,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
the
 
floor.
 
Go
 
ahead.
 
Introduce
 
yourself,
 
please.
 
And
 
I'm
 
sorry
 
if
 
I'm
 
lucky
 
to
 
be
 
frank
 
and
 
to
 
direct.
 
 
@5:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
it's
 
completely
 
good.
 
I'm
 
also
 
like
 
that.
 
So
 
I'm
 
glad
 
you
 
did
 
that
 
in
 
seven
 
minutes
 
and
 
we
 
didn't
 
go
 
into
 
talks
 
about
 
dogs
 
and
 
stuff.
 
So,
 
yes,
 
from
 
what
 
you
 
saw
 
in
 
the
 
ads,
 
I
 
am
 
a
 
small
 
operation.
 
I
 
have
 
actually,
 
I
 
am
 
from
 
Israel.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
anything
 
with
 
Israel.
 
So
 
it's
 
free
 
to
 
know
 
that.
 
And,
 
yes,
 
I
 
do
 
have
 
a
 
small
 
operation.
 
have
 
a
 
marketing
 
agency
 
in
 
Israel
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
I
 
am
 
pivoting
 
to
 
the
 
U.S.
 
market
 
with
 
the
 
goal
 
to
 
actually
 
help
 
clinics,
 
you
 
know,
 
like
 
yours
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
to
 
actually
 
fix
 
their
 
marketing.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you've
 
seen
 
my
 
YouTube
 
videos
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
simple
 
purpose.
 
I'm
 
not
 
trying
 
to
 
have
 
high-quality
 
content.
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
valuable.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
practical.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
people
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
Okay.
 
And
 
important
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
know,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
did
 
you
 
see,
 
did
 
it
 
seem
 
to
 
you
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about?
 
Like
 
that's
 
the
 
first
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
know.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
that's
 
very
 
important
 
because
 
that's
 
important
 
to
 
me.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
funds,
 
honestly,
 
I
 
do
 
have
 
the
 
funds
 
to
 
grow
 
the
 
agency.
 
I'm
 
doing
 
it
 
bits
 
by
 
bits.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
sales
 
calls
 
here
 
and
 
there.
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
snowball
 
effect.
 
Also,
 
I'm
 
in
 
a
 
coaching
 
program
 
of
 
this
 
guy.
 
You
 
can
 
search
 
him
 
up
 
called
 
Cameron
 
England.
 
He
 
actually
 
scaled
 
an
 
agency.
 
$300,000
 
a
 
month.
 
I
 
basically
 
all
 
the
 
tools
 
to,
 
to
 
scale
 
that
 
thing
 
is
 
having
 
a,
 
having
 
somebody
 
that
 
is
 
an
 
actual
 
doctor.
 
And
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
ads.
 
I
 
saw
 
they
 
have
 
94
 
ads
 
running
 
in
 
your
 
ads
 
library,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
ads,
 
which
 
means
 
you're
 
doing
 
something
 
right.
 
Um,
 
it
 
could
 
definitely
 
be
 
an
 
interesting,
 
uh,
 
an
 
interesting
 
thing
 
to
 
do.
 
Now,
 
question
 
is
 
what
 
type
 
of
 
service
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
provide
 
to
 
the
 
clinics?
 
Because,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
things.
 
For
 
example,
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
client
 
now
 
that
 
I'm,
 
I'm,
 
for-
 
I'm
 
on
 
a
 
system
 
to
 
have
 
voice
 
AI
 
implemented.
 
And
 
instead
 
of
 
having
 
a
 
call
 
center,
 
then
 
the
 
voice
 
AI
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
call
 
leads,
 
qualify
 
them,
 
book
 
them
 
into
 
the
 
consultation.
 
And
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
all
 
the
 
follow
 
process.
 
You
 
mean
 
when
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
these
 
guys
 
from
 
Pakistan,
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
train
 
them
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
just
 
upload
 
the
 
ads?
 
Because
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
creative
 
and
 
writing
 
ads
 
and
 
copywriting
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
I
 
do
 
everything
 
on
 
my
 
own,
 
even
 
when
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
sell
 
the
 
agency
 
to
 
$100,000
 
a
 
month,
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
simple
 
fact
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
best
 
at.
 
That's
 
what
 
I'm
 
good
 
at.
 
 
@7:31
 
-
 
Amir
 
This
 
is
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
I
 
created
 
the
 
voice
 
AIs,
 
chat
 
AIs.
 
I
 
implemented
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
We
 
call
 
it
 
Ashley.
 
In
 
my
 
office,
 
say,
 
hey,
 
did
 
Ashley
 
do
 
this?
 
Did
 
Ashley
 
do
 
that?
 
And
 
these
 
guys
 
in
 
Pakistan
 
and
 
India,
 
they
 
are
 
just
 
technical
 
guys.
 
You
 
tell
 
them
 
what
 
to
 
do,
 
they
 
do
 
it.
 
I
 
exactly
 
want
 
that.
 
Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
am
 
the
 
creative
 
person
 
here.
 
The
 
ads
 
that
 
you're
 
seeing.
 
So
 
created
 
all
 
of
 
those.
 
I'm
 
running
 
all
 
the
 
campaigns.
 
But
 
what
 
happens
 
is
 
when
 
I
 
go
 
on
 
GoHighLevel
 
and
 
something
 
is
 
not
 
getting
 
tracked
 
correctly,
 
I
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
guy
 
and
 
say,
 
hey,
 
you
 
know
 
what?
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
getting
 
tracked
 
correctly.
 
Go
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
backlinks
 
or
 
whatever.
 
Or
 
SEO
 
or
 
Google.
 
I
 
told
 
the
 
guy,
 
hey,
 
just
 
create
 
my
 
Google
 
campaign,
 
but
 
all
 
the
 
keywords,
 
everything,
 
searching
 
the
 
keywords,
 
I
 
did
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
Because
 
this
 
guy
 
knows
 
WordPress.
 
This
 
guy
 
knows
 
SEO.
 
This
 
guy
 
knows
 
campaigns.
 
One
 
of
 
them,
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
knows
 
GoHighLevel,
 
like
 
automation.
 
They
 
know
 
all
 
of
 
that,
 
but
 
they
 
don't
 
know
 
neuromodulation.
 
That
 
is
 
the
 
problem.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
was
 
missing
 
from
 
beyond
 
marketing
 
and
 
all
 
those,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
because
 
that's
 
exactly
 
what
 
they
 
do.
 
They
 
get
 
me
 
as
 
a
 
psychiatrist,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
tell
 
this
 
guy
 
in
 
Pakistan
 
that,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
go
 
and
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
shoot
 
a
 
bazooka.
 
So
 
All
 
But
 
they
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
they're
 
targeting.
 
They
 
don't
 
know
 
who
 
they're
 
targeting.
 
If
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
it,
 
it's
 
very
 
interesting.
 
I'm
 
pretty
 
sure
 
you're
 
familiar
 
with
 
Greenbrook's.
 
The
 
only
 
Greenbrook's
 
ad
 
that's
 
running
 
for
 
Spravato
 
is
 
the
 
Spravato
 
nasal
 
spray.
 
And
 
then
 
it
 
says,
 
FDA
 
approved,
 
insurance
 
covered,
 
patient
 
respond.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
know
 
what's
 
funny?
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
hear
 
something
 
insane?
 
I
 
am
 
consulting
 
to
 
Greenbrook
 
right
 
now.
 
I
 
started
 
last
 
week
 
to
 
consult
 
to
 
them.
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
revamp
 
their
 
whole
 
process
 
there
 
as
 
well
 
with
 
my
 
ads.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
transparent
 
with
 
you
 
about
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@9:41
 
-
 
Amir
 
That's
 
fine.
 
mean,
 
that's
 
okay.
 
But
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
only
 
ad
 
that
 
they're
 
running
 
for
 
Spravato
 
was
 
my
 
ad.
 
I
 
created
 
that
 
ad.
 
I
 
gave
 
it
 
to
 
Beyond
 
Marketing.
 
 
@9:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
started
 
running
 
that
 
ad
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
copied
 
it.
 
That's
 
crazy.
 
 
@9:56
 
-
 
Amir
 
I
 
mean,
 
you
 
know
 
what?
 
No,
 
that's
 
not
 
crazy.
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
don't
 
care.
 
But
 
what
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you
 
is
 
that
 
it
 
takes
 
a
 
psychiatrist
 
who
 
does
 
neuromodulation
 
to
 
understand
 
what
 
people
 
respond
 
to.
 
Because,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
they
 
were
 
coming
 
up
 
with
 
all
 
these
 
ads,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
happy
 
woman,
 
like,
 
oh,
 
my
 
God,
 
I'm
 
depressed.
 
I'm
 
like,
 
that's,
 
that's,
 
nobody
 
cares
 
about
 
that.
 
The
 
only
 
thing
 
people
 
care,
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
people
 
care
 
about
 
is,
 
am
 
I
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
better?
 
And
 
you
 
know
 
why
 
I
 
know
 
that?
 
Because
 
I
 
see,
 
like,
 
in
 
our
 
clinic,
 
we
 
see
 
almost
 
22,500
 
patients,
 
neuromodulation
 
patients.
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
know
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
combine
 
my
 
business-minded
 
approach
 
to
 
a
 
high-quality
 
psychiatry.
 
I
 
believe
 
I'm
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
best
 
psychiatrists
 
in
 
America.
 
I
 
got
 
trained
 
at
 
Johns
 
Hopkins.
 
I
 
was
 
an
 
engineer
 
before
 
coming
 
to
 
psychiatry.
 
You
 
know,
 
when
 
I
 
went
 
to
 
medical
 
school,
 
I
 
was
 
30
 
years
 
old.
 
So,
 
so
 
combine,
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
saying
 
that
 
is
 
because
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
that,
 
like,
 
it
 
takes
 
that
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
market.
 
Marketing
 
company,
 
who,
 
like,
 
what
 
it's
 
supposed
 
to
 
be.
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
cannot
 
market,
 
like,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
my
 
aunt
 
is
 
in
 
construction,
 
and
 
she
 
was
 
asking
 
me
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
help
 
her
 
with
 
marketing.
 
was
 
like,
 
no,
 
because
 
then
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
me,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
bringing
 
in
 
freelancers,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
don't
 
know
 
that,
 
we
 
don't
 
know
 
the
 
technology,
 
we
 
don't
 
know
 
the
 
market,
 
we
 
don't
 
know
 
who
 
your
 
customers
 
are.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
who
 
those
 
customers
 
are,
 
or
 
patients
 
are,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
be
 
able,
 
so
 
that's
 
the
 
very
 
first
 
thing,
 
and
 
then
 
it's
 
campaigns,
 
and
 
ads,
 
and
 
artwork,
 
and
 
then
 
after
 
that,
 
it's
 
all
 
the
 
other
 
crap,
 
like,
 
go
 
high
 
level,
 
and
 
voice
 
AI.
 
The
 
very
 
first
 
thing
 
is
 
that,
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
interacting
 
with
 
my
 
ads?
 
And,
 
and
 
now
 
I'm
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
numbers
 
that
 
I
 
have,
 
it's
 
more
 
than
 
300%
 
than
 
what
 
I
 
had
 
with
 
Beyond
 
Marketing,
 
I
 
worked
 
with
 
Beyond
 
Marketing
 
for
 
two
 
years,
 
it
 
just,
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
putting,
 
and
 
you
 
know,
 
I,
 
like
 
my
 
campaigns,
 
I
 
was
 
always
 
allocating
 
about.
 
Six
 
to
 
seven
 
thousand
 
dollars
 
a
 
month
 
to
 
all
 
of
 
my
 
campaigns.
 
Now,
 
half
 
that
 
money
 
tripled
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
leads
 
and
 
our
 
scheduled
 
patients
 
more
 
than
 
ever.
 
So,
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure.
 
mean,
 
again,
 
this
 
is
 
just
 
the
 
spark
 
of
 
an
 
idea.
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
if
 
you're
 
interested
 
or
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
look
 
and
 
just
 
work
 
together.
 
You
 
know,
 
somehow,
 
obviously,
 
there's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
so
 
many
 
conflict
 
of
 
interest.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
this
 
is
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like
 
it
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
strong
 
long
 
term
 
relationship
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
this.
 
And
 
again,
 
you
 
know,
 
your
 
role
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
just
 
managing
 
the
 
freelancers.
 
But
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
basically
 
between
 
me
 
and
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
main
 
producers
 
of
 
the
 
ideas
 
and
 
then
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
the
 
company.
 
And
 
then
 
talking
 
to
 
all
 
these
 
doctors
 
and
 
then
 
and
 
then
 
getting
 
them
 
to
 
to
 
sign.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
specific
 
doctor.
 
The
 
population
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
target,
 
like
 
the
 
product
 
that
 
I'm
 
creating,
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
cost
 
a
 
lot.
 
So
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
doctors
 
who
 
are
 
serious
 
about
 
neuromodulation.
 
If
 
somebody
 
wants
 
to
 
do
 
three
 
TMS
 
patients
 
a
 
day
 
and
 
then
 
two
 
escedamine
 
patients
 
a
 
week,
 
that's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
This
 
is
 
geared
 
towards
 
somebody
 
like,
 
not
 
like
 
us,
 
because
 
we
 
are
 
seeing
 
about
 
30
 
to
 
40
 
neuromodulation
 
patients
 
a
 
day.
 
But
 
at
 
least
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
see
 
at
 
least
 
between
 
15
 
to
 
20
 
neuromodulation
 
encounters
 
a
 
day
 
for
 
this
 
product
 
to
 
make
 
sense
 
for
 
a
 
company.
 
So
 
I'm
 
still
 
in
 
the
 
infancy
 
and
 
I'm
 
creating
 
these
 
ideas
 
in
 
my
 
head.

But
 
again,
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
video
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
let
 
me
 
just
 
give
 
it
 
a
 
shot.
 
That's
 
great.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
and
 
I'll
 
be
 
completely
 
honest.
 
I
 
know
 
Beyond
 
Marketing,
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
Patient
 
Plus,
 
all
 
these
 
people.
 
And
 
I'm
 
hopping
 
on
 
calls
 
like,
 
actually,
 
I
 
hopped
 
on
 
a
 
call.
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
sales
 
call
 
two
 
months
 
ago
 
with
 
this
 
woman.
 
I
 
Ayanna
 
Williams.
 
I
 
can
 
send
 
you
 
a
 
clinic
 
or
 
whatever.
 
And
 
PatientPlus,
 
she
 
went
 
to
 
PatientPlus.
 
I
 
told
 
her
 
because
 
I
 
told
 
her,
 
listen,
 
I'm
 
new
 
in
 
this.
 
Don't
 
pay
 
me
 
money.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
it.
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
your
 
results,
 
then
 
pay
 
me.
 
And
 
PatientPlus,
 
somehow
 
with
 
better
 
sales,
 
things
 
actually
 
converted
 
her.
 
She
 
has
 
currently,
 
I
 
hopped
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
her
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
days
 
ago.
 
I
 
followed
 
up
 
with
 
her.
 
She
 
has
 
a
 
$70
 
cost
 
per
 
lead.
 
She
 
got
 
17
 
leads
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
month.
 
None
 
of
 
them
 
even
 
booked
 
a
 
consultation.
 
That's
 
like
 
what
 
you
 
said
 
about
 
the
 
ads.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
shocked
 
because
 
I
 
was
 
in
 
my
 
eyes.
 
was
 
like,
 
maybe
 
I'm
 
doing
 
something
 
wrong
 
here.
 
So
 
why
 
am
 
I
 
even
 
saying
 
that?
 
Why
 
am
 
saying
 
all
 
of
 
this?
 
Is
 
there
 
anything
 
specific
 
that
 
intrigued
 
you
 
me?
 
Is
 
it
 
because
 
I'm
 
small?
 
Did
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
other
 
people
 
and
 
you
 
thought
 
about
 
talking
 
to
 
them?
 
Like
 
what
 
specifically
 
with
 
me?
 
Because
 
I'm
 
100%
 
honest
 
with
 
you
 
and
 
I'm
 
vulnerable
 
with
 
you.

Amir
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
100%
 
honest
 
with
 
you.
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
gave...
 
That's
 
answer.
 
My
 
answer
 
is,
 
you
 
are
 
a
 
motivated
 
individual,
 
which
 
I
 
thought
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
resources.
 
And
 
I
 
thought
 
that
 
if
 
I
 
bring
 
my
 
expertise
 
and
 
resources
 
with
 
somebody
 
who
 
knows
 
the
 
market,
 
who
 
I
 
can
 
offload,
 
like,
 
you
 
my
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
offload
 
this
 
business
 
idea
 
to
 
somebody
 
who
 
knows
 
the
 
business
 
as
 
a
 
business
 
partner,
 
and
 
then
 
let
 
that
 
person,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
take
 
over.
 
That
 
was,
 
like,
 
beyond
 
marketing
 
and
 
stuff,
 
like,
 
they're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to,
 
like,
 
they're
 
a
 
company,
 
they're
 
an
 
organization
 
by
 
themselves.
 
But,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
seem
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
a
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
or
 
three
 
people
 
company,
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
okay,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
that's
 
what
 
I,
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
want,
 
that's
 
who
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
with.
 
And
 
then
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
again,
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
looking
 
at
 
your
 
videos,
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
talking
 
about.
 
Obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
know,
 
if,
 
if,
 
if
 
we
 
agree
 
to
 
go
 
beyond
 
this
 
conversation,
 
I
 
want,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
know
 
you,
 
and
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
your,
 
your
 
clinical
 
knowledge
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
neuromodulation
 
of,
 
I
 
mean,
 
again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
we,
 
we
 
sign
 
a
 
prenup,
 
and
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
we,
 
we,
 
we
 
disclose
 
some
 
information
 
from
 
And
 
then
 
we,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
assess.
 
Obviously,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
assess
 
me.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can,
 
I'm
 
saying
 
60,
 
70,
 
you
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
I
 
might
 
be
 
lying.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
are
 
saying
 
that,
 
look,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about,
 
and
 
you
 
might
 
be
 
lying.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
each
 
other
 
and
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
are
 
the
 
partners
 
that
 
we're
 
looking
 
for.
 
And
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
if
 
you
 
were,
 
probably
 
you
 
weren't
 
looking
 
for
 
a
 
partner.
 
I
 
am,
 
because
 
I
 
need
 
somebody
 
to
 
run
 
this
 
because
 
I
 
can't
 
do
 
both.

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
can't
 
be,
 
I
 
can't
 
dedicate
 
my
 
time
 
to
 
both
 
of
 
these
 
companies.
 
Yeah,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
I
 
understand
 
you.
 
So
 
this
 
is,
 
this
 
sounds
 
very
 
interesting.
 
Okay.
 
When
 
you
 
say
 
about
 
a
 
partner,
 
I'm
 
not
 
looking
 
for
 
a
 
partner.
 
I
 
actually,
 
I
 
was,
 
I
 
was
 
supposed
 
to
 
start
 
a
 
partnership
 
with
 
these
 
two
 
guys,
 
Chris,
 
Chris
 
Shefford.
 
He
 
has
 
a
 
clinic
 
called
 
brainstem
 
TMS
 
and
 
another
 
girl
 
who
 
has
 
a
 
clinic
 
called
 
USA
 
brain
 
sciences.
 
They
 
both
 
do
 
TMS
 
for
 
some
 
reason.
 
I
 
was
 
with
 
them.
 
created
 
ads
 
for
 
them.
 
were
 
supposed
 
to
 
start
 
like
 
this
 
partnership
 
marketing
 
agency,
 
but
 
something
 
didn't
 
add
 
up
 
to
 
me.
 
And
 
then
 
my
 
dad
 
passed.
 
They
 
didn't
 
talk
 
to
 
me
 
at
 
all.
 
And
 
then
 
they
 
just
 
removed
 
me.
 
They
 
removed
 
me
 
from
 
the
 
ad
 
accounts.
 
And
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
you
 
know
 
what?
 
This
 
was
 
supposed
 
to
 
happen.
 
I
 
felt
 
relief.
 
And
 
I
 
actually,
 
I
 
do
 
want
 
a
 
partner
 
that
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
complete
 
me.
 
And
 
you
 
may
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
complete
 
me
 
because
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
resources.
 
I
 
can,
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
leverage
 
your
 
expertise
 
and
 
integrate
 
my
 
marketing
 
to
 
this.
 
And
 
if
 
we
 
actually
 
implement
 
this
 
and
 
you
 
know,
 
we,
 
you
 
seem
 
like
 
if
 
you
 
did
 
everything
 
that
 
you
 
did
 
in
 
the,
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
what
 
you
 
said,
 
what,
 
eight,
 
nine
 
months.
 
Six
 
months.
 
 
@17:40
 
-
 
Amir
 
Yeah.
 
 
@17:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Six
 
months.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
extremely
 
fast,
 
extremely
 
fast.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
that
 
shows
 
me,
 
that
 
shows
 
me
 
not
 
your
 
determination,
 
but
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
your
 
understanding
 
and
 
also
 
your,
 
the,
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
you
 
catch
 
things.
 
And
 
I,
 
and
 
I
 
appreciate
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
appreciate
 
that.
 
So
 
yes,
 
I
 
am
 
very
 
interested
 
in
 
talking
 
more
 
about
 
this.
 
Definitely
 
something
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
think
 
about.
 
As
 
you
 
said,
 
there
 
is
 
conflict
 
of
 
interest.
 
need
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
we
 
built
 
that
 
out,
 
how
 
we
 
laid
 
that
 
out
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
it's
 
good
 
for
 
both
 
sides,
 
okay?
 
Because
 
I
 
can
 
definitely
 
see
 
us
 
building
 
something
 
great
 
here
 
100%.
 
And
 
I'm
 
not
 
saying
 
that
 
just
 
because
 
I'm
 
like,
 
oh,
 
this
 
is
 
such
 
an
 
exciting
 
opportunity.
 
Yes,
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
exciting
 
opportunity
 
for
 
me
 
for
 
two
 
reasons.
 
One,
 
I've
 
seen
 
your
 
ads
 
and
 
I
 
actually,
 
when
 
I
 
first
 
started,
 
I
 
looked
 
at
 
the
 
clinics
 
and
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
clinic.
 
was
 
like,
 
hmm,
 
this
 
guy's
 
probably
 
running
 
with
 
a
 
huge
 
marketing
 
agency.
 
He
 
has
 
all
 
these
 
ads
 
and
 
everything.
 
And
 
then
 
that
 
you
 
sent
 
me
 
a
 
message,
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
who
 
is
 
this
 
guy?
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
just
 
looked
 
at
 
your
 
ads
 
before
 
I
 
call.
 
was
 
like,
 
holy,
 
holy
 
,
 
that's
 
this
 
guy.
 
Which
 
was
 
very
 
nice
 
to
 
see
 
that.
 
was
 
like,
 
damn,
 
okay,
 
it
 
means
 
I'm
 
doing
 
something
 
right
 
with
 
my
 
content
 
and
 
everything.
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
first
 
thing.
 
Second
 
thing,
 
that
 
will
 
allow
 
me,
 
obviously,
 
to
 
get
 
my
 
purpose
 
across.
 
I
 
have
 
one
 
purpose,
 
which
 
is
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
world
 
1%
 
better.
 
You
 
know,
 
people
 
are
 
feeling
 
like
 
,
 
okay?
 
With
 
depression
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
tools.
 
And
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
psychiatrists
 
and
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
running
 
these
 
clinics
 
have
 
the
 
tools.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
can
 
definitely
 
see
 
this
 
as
 
something
 
interesting.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
from
 
you,
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
move
 
this
 
forward?
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
more
 
about
 
this,
 
you
 
know,
 
go
 
more
 
in
 
depth.
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
a,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
type
 
one
 
decision,
 
if
 
you
 
know,
 
like
 
what
 
a
 
type
 
one
 
and
 
type
 
two
 
decisions
 
are.
 
It's
 
not,
 
it's
 
when
 
it
 
happens,
 
it's
 
very
 
hard
 
to
 
reverse
 
that.
 
So
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
everything
 
is
 
dialed
 
in
 
and
 
that
 
we're
 
both
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
page,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
 
@19:28
 
-
 
Amir
 
So,
 
so
 
yeah,
 
and
 
then,
 
and
 
then,
 
you
 
know,
 
again,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
a,
 
I'm
 
a
 
go
 
getter.
 
Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
just,
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do.
 
I,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
feeling
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
too.
 
Again,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
know,
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
look
 
me
 
up.
 
I
 
looked
 
you
 
up.
 
Let's
 
yeah.
 
I
 
mean,
 
by
 
all
 
means,
 
I
 
mean,
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
wanted
 
to,
 
you
 
just
 
to
 
initiate
 
this
 
conversation
 
and
 
then
 
let's
 
let's
 
just
 
let,
 
let's,
 
let's
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
meeting.
 
For
 
early
 
next
 
week,
 
by
 
then,
 
let's
 
think
 
about
 
it
 
a
 
little
 
more,
 
again,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
gave
 
it
 
like
 
a
 
half
 
an
 
hour
 
thought,
 
so
 
let's,
 
let's
 
think
 
how
 
you
 
are,
 
how
 
we
 
can,
 
how
 
we
 
can
 
work
 
together,
 
and
 
then,
 
and
 
then
 
we'll
 
take
 
it
 
from
 
there.
 
 
@20:21

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
100%.
 
Is
 
there,
 
so
 
I
 
want,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
come
 
ready
 
to
 
the
 
call
 
next
 
week,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
come
 
and
 
say,
 
did
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
anything?
 
Is
 
there
 
anything
 
specific
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
for
 
me,
 
any
 
specific
 
things
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
bring
 
up,
 
because
 
I'll
 
tell
 
you
 
the
 
thing
 
about
 
me,
 
and
 
why
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
I'm
 
very
 
good
 
at
 
marketing,
 
is
 
that
 
because
 
in
 
Israel,
 
okay,
 
thing
 
is
 
in
 
Israel,
 
you
 
cannot
 
focus
 
on
 
a
 
specific
 
niche,
 
okay,
 
I
 
chose
 
TMS,
 
Ketamine,
 
and
 
Spravato,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you've
 
seen
 
one
 
of
 
my
 
videos
 
on
 
YouTube,
 
it's
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
simple
 
friend,
 
okay,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
saw
 
that
 
story,
 
he's
 
on
 
antidepressants,
 
okay,
 
and
 
since
 
he,
 
and
 
he
 
got
 
hooked,
 
quote
 
unquote,
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
presence
 
when
 
he
 
was
 
not,
 
Today,
 
he's
 
21.
 
Not
 
the
 
same
 
person
 
anymore.
 
He's
 
addicted
 
to
 
weed.
 
He's
 
lost.
 
He's
 
like,
 
it
 
just
 
messed
 
with
 
his
 
brain.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
in
 
my
 
head,
 
as
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
is
 
very
 
obsessed
 
with
 
psilocybin
 
and
 
psychedelics,
 
I
 
was
 
trying
 
to
 
look
 
up
 
what's
 
the
 
status
 
of
 
that.
 
That's
 
exactly
 
what
 
happened.
 
And
 
I
 
figured
 
out
 
that
 
there's,
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
ketamine?
 
Ketamine
 
actually
 
helps.
 
Like,
 
that's
 
a
 
thing
 
in
 
the
 
US.
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
okay,
 
I'm
 
getting
 
tired
 
of
 
this
 
agency
 
in
 
Israel.
 
Because
 
in
 
Israel,
 
need
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
everybody.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
because
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
everybody,
 
with
 
every
 
single
 
clinic.
 
So
 
for
 
example,
 
not
 
clinic,
 
sorry,
 
business,
 
you
 
have,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
client
 
that
 
sells
 
a
 
coaching
 
program
 
for
 
people
 
how
 
to
 
buy
 
and
 
invest
 
in
 
land,
 
carpentry
 
courses,
 
dating,
 
a
 
guy
 
that
 
sells
 
multimedia
 
like
 
things
 
for
 
cars.
 
So
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
marketing
 
at
 
its
 
core.
 
Okay.
 
If
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
the
 
OGs
 
like
 
Gary
 
Halbert
 
or
 
Eugene
 
Schwartz
 
and
 
all
 
these
 
great
 
copywriters.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
core,
 
and
 
when
 
you
 
understand
 
the
 
core,
 
it's
 
way
 
easier
 
to
 
run
 
marketing.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
from
 
you
 
exactly
 
then,
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
saying
 
that,
 
is
 
there
 
anything
 
specific
 
that
 
you
 
expect
 
from
 
me?
 
Is
 
there
 
something
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
come
 
with
 
next
 
week?
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
send
 
phone
 
numbers
 
of
 
clients?
 
Like
 
everything
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
come
 
ready
 
to
 
next
 
week
 
and
 
be
 
prepared?
 
Because
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
just
 
come
 
and
 
be
 
like,
 
okay,
 
what
 
are
 
we
 
doing
 
here?
 
 
@22:23
 
-
 
Amir
 
Absolutely,
 
and
 
that's
 
a
 
good
 
thing.
 
So
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
things.
 
Because
 
you
 
know,
 
instead
 
of,
 
instead
 
of,
 
you
 
know,
 
let's
 
just
 
take
 
one
 
step
 
back.
 
So
 
let's,
 
the
 
next
 
meeting,
 
let
 
it
 
just
 
be
 
about,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
detailed
 
introduction.
 
And
 
maybe
 
a
 
verbal
 
resume,
 
like
 
what
 
have
 
you
 
done?
 
And,
 
and,
 
and
 
then
 
realistic
 
numbers.
 
And
 
by
 
that,
 
I
 
mean.
 
Yes,
 
everybody
 
wants
 
to
 
be
 
rich.
 
Everybody
 
wants
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
business
 
and
 
then
 
just
 
make
 
millions
 
and
 
millions
 
of
 
dollars.
 
 
@23:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
a
 
given.
 
 
@23:08
 
-
 
Amir
 
But
 
what
 
is
 
your
 
realistic
 
number?
 
In
 
order
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
say,
 
okay,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
work,
 
is
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
number
 
in
 
mind,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
five-year
 
and
 
a
 
10-year
 
goal.
 
 
@23:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Because
 
if
 
your
 
10-year
 
goal
 
is
 
$5
 
million
 
a
 
year,
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
 
@23:33
 
-
 
Amir
 
Because
 
I
 
cannot
 
imagine,
 
I
 
cannot
 
forecast
 
that.
 
100%.
 
So
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
realistic
 
goal.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
hear
 
your
 
realistic
 
goal.
 
And
 
again,
 
I
 
mean,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
when
 
I
 
started
 
this
 
business,
 
I
 
was,
 
you
 
know,
 
I,
 
my
 
goal
 
was
 
to
 
do
 
1.5
 
million
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
year,
 
we
 
did
 
three.
 
So,
 
so
 
we
 
set
 
a
 
goal,
 
we
 
set
 
a
 
realistic
 
goal,
 
if
 
we
 
surpass
 
it.
 
Awesome.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
surpass
 
it,
 
at
 
least,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
have,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
have
 
an
 
understanding
 
of,
 
okay,
 
so
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
this
 
is
 
what,
 
this
 
is
 
where
 
we
 
are.
 
The
 
other
 
thing
 
is,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
partnership.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
company,
 
you
 
have,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
have
 
a,
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
name
 
for
 
yourself.
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
company
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
name
 
for
 
myself.
 
How
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to,
 
how
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to
 
decide
 
about
 
how,
 
how
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to
 
pursue
 
a
 
partnership
 
company?
 
Like,
 
know,
 
who's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
charge
 
of
 
what?
 
Again,
 
not
 
in
 
detail,
 
but
 
I
 
think
 
like,
 
you
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
your
 
version
 
of
 
things
 
and
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
my
 
version
 
of
 
things
 
and
 
then
 
see
 
which
 
one
 
works
 
better.
 
then
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
back
 
and
 
forth,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
see,
 
like,
 
you
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
an
 
agreement.
 
Because
 
again,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
understand
 
making
 
a
 
company,
 
like,
 
and
 
it's
 
your,
 
it's,
 
it's
 
like
 
your
 
child.
 
Obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm,
 
I
 
think
 
I'm
 
older
 
than
 
you
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
experience.
 
But,
 
but
 
obviously,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
created
 
something
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
you,
 
you,
 
you
 
value
 
it.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
you
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
approach
 
that.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
next
 
one
 
should
 
be
 
about
 
that,
 
just
 
getting
 
to
 
know
 
each
 
other
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
more,
 
doing
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
a
 
due
 
diligence.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
got
 
to
 
look
 
you
 
up
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
deeper.
 
 
@25:10
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
You
 
should
 
do
 
that,
 
too.
 
 
@25:12
 
-
 
Amir
 
And
 
then
 
just
 
verbally
 
talk
 
about
 
what
 
have
 
we
 
done
 
so
 
far,
 
and
 
then
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
future
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
like
 
for
 
both
 
of
 
us.

100%.
 
 
@25:23
 
-
 
Amir
 
That
 
sounds
 
good.
 
 
@25:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@25:25
 
-
 
Amir
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we'll
 
talk,
 
we'll
 
talk
 
with,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
will
 
communicate
 
via
 
email.
 
But
 
let
 
me,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
check
 
my
 
schedule,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
will
 
let
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
availabilities
 
I
 
have,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
let
 
me
 
know
 
what
 
availabilities
 
you
 
have.
 
 
@25:38

Oriel

100%.
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
early
 
next
 
week,
 
I
 
don't
 
currently
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
things
 
booked.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
tell
 
me
 
what
 
your
 
availability
 
is,
 
and
 
we
 
can
 
just
 
basically
 
book
 
it.
 
So
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
know.
 
 
@25:47
 
-
 
Amir
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
Well,
 
Ariel,
 
it
 
was
 
very
 
nice
 
meeting
 
you.
 
 
@25:50

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Nice
 
meeting
 
you,
 
too.
 
 
@25:53
 
-
 
Amir
 
To
 
potentially
 
work
 
with
 
you,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
this.
 
 
@25:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
That
 
sounds
 
good.
 
Thank
 
you
 
so
 
much,
 
Amir.
 
Have
 
a
 
great
 
rest
 
of
 
your
 
day,
 
and
 
you.
 
 
@26:00
 
-
 
Amir
 
You
 
really
 
sound
 
like
 
a
 
great
 
guy.
 
Like
 
I
 
honestly
 
say
 
that,
 
so.
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
too.
 
Have
 
a
 
good
 
day.
 
Thank
 
you,
 
man.
 
Have
 
a
 
good
 
day.
 
Bye-bye.

This
 
meeting
 
is
 
being
 
recorded.
 
Somebody
 
here?
 
Or?
 
My
 
apocalyptic
 
land.
 
Oh,
 
sounds
 
like
 
I
 
am.
 
 
@0:58

Melissa.
 
Oh.
 
Oh.
 
Oh.
 
Oh.
 
Oh.
 
You
 
Hi,
 
I
 
think
 
we're
 
waiting
 
for
 
Shantz
 
to
 
join.
 
 
@1:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
Thanks,
 
Al.
 
 
@1:27
 
-
 
Melissa.
 
Bye-bye.
 
Bye-bye.
 
Bye-bye.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
@2:45
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Hey,
 
man.
 
Sorry
 
about
 
that.
 
 
@2:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
How's
 
it
 
going?
 
 
@2:49
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
It's
 
going
 
good,
 
man.
 
How
 
are
 
you?
 
 
@2:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Great.
 
Great.
 
 
@2:54
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
So
 
Melissa
 
hopped
 
on,
 
and
 
then
 
Raleigh,
 
can
 
you
 
resend
 
her
 
the
 
link?
 
 
@3:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
She's
 
going
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
from
 
her
 
phone.
 
She's
 
not
 
here
 
yet.
 
Should
 
I
 
set
 
in
 
the
 
Slack?
 
 
@3:07
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
she
 
has
 
Slack
 
on
 
her
 
phone.
 
I
 
know
 
she
 
has
 
it
 
on
 
her
 
desktop,
 
but
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
she's
 
not
 
here
 
yet.
 
So
 
let
 
me,
 
matter
 
of
 
fact,
 
I
 
may
 
have
 
it.
 
 
@3:15
 
-
 
Melissa.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
her.
 
Let
 
me
 
just
 
text
 
her
 
the
 
Zoom
 
link.
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
text
 
her
 
the
 
Zoom
 
link.
 
 
@3:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
All
 
right,
 
that'll
 
work.
 
 
@3:24
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
You
 
know,
 
she's
 
young
 
and
 
she
 
overslept
 
her
 
alarm
 
and
 
I
 
get
 
it.
 
 
@3:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
You
 
know,
 
we've
 
all,
 
we've
 
all
 
been
 
there.
 
Bam.
 
If
 
there
 
would
 
be
 
more
 
employers
 
like
 
you.
 
 
@3:34
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah,
 
well,
 
I'm
 
about
 
to
 
have
 
to
 
start
 
doing
 
like
 
verbal
 
write-ups
 
and
 
stuff
 
like
 
that,
 
but
 
we'll
 
see.
 
We'll
 
see
 
how
 
it
 
goes.
 
I'm
 
probably
 
underpaying
 
her
 
right
 
now,
 
so
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
give
 
her
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
grace.
 
 
@3:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
makes
 
sense,
 
I
 
guess.
 
If
 
you're
 
underpaying
 
her,
 
She's
 
making
 
minimum
 
wage.
 
 
@3:57
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
And
 
I
 
told
 
my
 
wife
 
what
 
all
 
she's
 
doing.
 
She's
 
taking
 
a
 
little.
 
My
 
wife's
 
duties
 
when
 
she
 
left
 
for
 
the
 
baby
 
stuff,
 
and
 
she
 
says,
 
Schantz,
 
you're
 
not
 
paying
 
her
 
enough.
 
I
 
said,
 
okay.
 
I
 
said,
 
okay,
 
I'll
 
try
 
to
 
figure
 
something
 
out.
 
How
 
are
 
you,
 
man?
 
How's
 
everything
 
going?
 
 
@4:15
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
cool.
 
I'm
 
getting
 
back
 
to
 
work
 
and
 
everything,
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see.
 
Yeah,
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
back
 
to
 
work,
 
getting
 
on
 
my
 
stuff.
 
 
@4:26
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I
 
turned
 
my
 
ads
 
back
 
on.
 
It's
 
been
 
a
 
while
 
since
 
I
 
–
 
I
 
that,
 
man.
 
That
 
new
 
one,
 
I
 
like
 
it.
 
 
@4:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
like
 
your
 
new
 
one.
 
The
 
one
 
with
 
the
 
brain
 
scan?
 
Yeah.
 
Or
 
the
 
VSL?
 
Yeah,
 
there's
 
two.
 
Yeah.
 
It
 
came
 
to
 
intuition
 
because
 
I
 
started
 
to
 
do
 
more.
 
I'm
 
walking
 
every
 
single
 
morning
 
now,
 
and
 
I'm
 
waking
 
up
 
way
 
earlier.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
helping
 
my
 
brain
 
be
 
more
 
intuitive
 
and
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
ideas
 
really
 
fast.
 
Yeah.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
Dude,
 
I'm
 
out
 
there.
 
 
@4:59
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I'm
 
What
 
was
 
it,
 
last
 
year?
 
Every
 
now
 
and
 
I'll
 
get
 
on
 
a
 
kick
 
and
 
I'll
 
get
 
up
 
at
 
like,
 
I'll
 
start
 
getting
 
up
 
at
 
like
 
5,
 
5.30
 
in
 
morning.
 
It's
 
hard
 
to
 
do
 
when
 
I
 
have
 
my
 
two
 
kids
 
and
 
I'm
 
exhausted
 
all
 
the
 
time,
 
but
 
I
 
was
 
getting
 
up
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
was
 
like
 
taking
 
cold
 
showers
 
for
 
like
 
10
 
minutes
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
I
 
got
 
up,
 
get
 
that
 
little
 
quick
 
spark,
 
better
 
than
 
a
 
cup
 
of
 
coffee,
 
and
 
I
 
was
 
getting
 
all
 
kinds
 
of
 
work.
 
I
 
was
 
super
 
productive,
 
man.
 
When
 
I'm
 
doing
 
that,
 
I'm
 
super
 
productive
 
in
 
time
 
to
 
get
 
your
 
day
 
started
 
like
 
that.

Yeah,
 
it's
 
definitely
 
a
 
big
 
shifter.
 
Also,
 
I'm
 
sleeping,
 
like
 
the
 
craziest
 
thing
 
is,
 
before
 
my
 
dad
 
passed,
 
I
 
used
 
to
 
wake
 
up
 
at
 
like
 
10,
 
11,
 
and
 
throughout
 
like
 
in
 
3,
 
4
 
p.m.,
 
5
 
p.m.,
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
exhausted.
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
like
 
drained
 
out
 
of
 
energy.
 
Now,
 
I'm
 
sleeping
 
less,
 
I'm
 
sleeping
 
six
 
hours,
 
and
 
I'm
 
still
 
not
 
tired
 
at
 
4
 
p.m.,
 
even
 
though
 
I
 
wake
 
up
 
at
 
6.30,
 
which
 
is
 
unbelievable.

It's

It's
 
crazy
 
how

It
 
works,
 
for

It's

It's
 
just
 
unbelievable.
 
 
@6:05

All
 
right.
 
Well,
 
we
 
got
 
Melissa.
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
got
 
things
 
to
 
do.
 
 
@6:09

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
We
 
got
 
things.
 
So
 
Riley
 
can
 
just
 
pop
 
on
 
and
 
listen
 
whenever
 
she
 
gets
 
in.
 
 
@6:12

Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah.
 
Let
 
me
 
shut
 
my
 
door.
 
Melissa,
 
are
 
you
 
still
 
at
 
the
 
front,
 
or
 
are
 
you
 
back
 
in
 
your
 
office?
 
I
 
bet
 
she's
 
at
 
the
 
front
 
still.
 
All
 
right.
 
Not
 
because
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
hide
 
anything.
 
I
 
just
 
can
 
pay
 
attention
 
better
 
if
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
people
 
walking
 
past
 
my
 
door
 
in
 
the
 
hallway.

Yeah,
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
stats
 
to
 
go
 
over.
 
Kind
 
of
 
simplified
 
things.
 
Didn't
 
want
 
to
 
overcomplicate
 
it.
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
simple
 
stats.
 
I've
 
made
 
like
 
a
 
simple
 
Google
 
Doc.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
this
 
better.
 
I
 
think
 
I'm
 
actually,
 
with
 
my
 
Israeli
 
clients,
 
I'm
 
using
 
a
 
Google
 
Sheet
 
that
 
updates
 
statuses
 
based
 
on
 
where
 
people
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
pipeline.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
And
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
filter
 
them
 
through
 
the
 
Google
 
Sheet.
 
SCREEN
 
SHARING:
 
Oriel
 
started
 
screen
 
sharing
 
-
 
WATCH
 
We
 
every
 
single
 
month
 
and
 
see
 
exactly
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
But
 
for
 
now,
 
just
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
tags
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
in
 
the
 
go-eye
 
level,
 
made
 
this
 
little
 
thing,
 
and
 
it's
 
very
 
simple.
 
It's
 
very
 
easy
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
bottlenecks
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
from
 
here.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
obviously,
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
leads
 
that
 
we
 
got
 
up
 
until
 
now
 
was
 
139
 
since
 
we
 
started,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
lot.
 
And
 
total
 
bookends,
 
we
 
got
 
23,
 
which
 
is
 
also
 
good.
 
The
 
cost
 
per
 
bookend
 
is
 
good.
 
The
 
booking
 
rate,
 
though,
 
is
 
not
 
good,
 
which
 
means
 
we
 
either
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
with
 
calling
 
them
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible,
 
not
 
calling
 
them
 
enough
 
time,
 
or
 
creating
 
urgency.
 
These
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
three
 
factors
 
that
 
will
 
determine
 
the
 
booking
 
rate.
 
So
 
I
 
do
 
want
 
them
 
to
 
hop
 
on,
 
and
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
they're
 
doing
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
calling
 
people.
 
Because
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
people
 
can
 
come
 
in
 
and
 
leave
 
their
 
details
 
after
 
business
 
hours,
 
and
 
yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
But
 
first
 
thing
 
to
 
call
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
mornings,
 
send
 
the
 
messages,
 
do
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
The
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
is
 
good,
 
but
 
obviously,
 
the
 
show.
 
The
 
no-shows
 
are
 
very
 
bad,
 
and
 
I'm
 
very
 
surprised
 
because
 
a
 
week
 
after
 
we
 
started,
 
we
 
changed
 
the
 
protocol
 
to
 
take
 
credit
 
cards.
 
So
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
come
 
the
 
shows
 
is
 
really
 
low
 
because
 
from
 
what
 
I
 
see
 
and
 
go
 
high
 
level,
 
just
 
a
 
second,
 
from
 
what
 
I
 
see.
 
 
@8:18

That
 
cancellation
 
rate,
 
and
 
that's
 
what
 
we're
 
seeing,
 
man,
 
is
 
the
 
cancellation,
 
and
 
it's
 
the
 
no-shows.
 
Honestly,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
the
 
no-shows
 
have
 
gotten
 
worse
 
because
 
people
 
are
 
calling,
 
like,
 
the
 
day
 
ahead
 
of
 
time,
 
and
 
so
 
I
 
know
 
that's
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
things,
 
and
 
then
 
it's
 
the
 
girls,
 
the
 
people
 
will
 
book,
 
and
 
they'll
 
say,
 
like,
 
tentative
 
appointment
 
on
 
our
 
side.
 
Well,
 
we
 
don't
 
ever
 
actually
 
confirm
 
it
 
until
 
they'll
 
answer
 
their
 
phone
 
and
 
talk
 
to
 
Riley
 
or
 
Adriana
 
or
 
somebody,
 
and
 
they're
 
able
 
to,
 
like,
 
send
 
them
 
all
 
the
 
consent
 
forms,
 
everything
 
like
 
that,
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
when
 
they
 
have
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
credit
 
card
 
information.
 
Well,
 
I
 
know
 
Melissa,
 
she's
 
a
 
therapist,
 
so
 
she's
 
not
 
even
 
working
 
in
 
the
 
front,
 
but
 
when
 
she
 
was...
 
She
 
was
 
slow
 
one
 
day.
 
She
 
got
 
on
 
and
 
heard
 
of
 
calling
 
people
 
for
 
us.
 
And
 
she
 
had
 
several
 
at
 
the
 
moment
 
she
 
asked
 
for
 
a
 
credit
 
card.
 
They
 
were
 
like,
 
no,
 
never
 
mind.
 
And
 
they
 
wouldn't
 
do
 
it,
 
which
 
is
 
good,
 
man.
 
I
 
like
 
that's
 
good
 
because
 
that
 
means
 
they're
 
not
 
really
 
serious
 
about
 
it
 
anyway.
 
And
 
they're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
block
 
a
 
time.
 
But
 
that's
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
things.
 
It's
 
that
 
whole,
 
it's
 
Tebra,
 
dude.
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
how
 
the
 
flow
 
is
 
with
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
and
 
Tebra.
 
It's
 
garbage.
 
And
 
it's
 
this
 
extra
 
work
 
on
 
the
 
front
 
is
 
rough.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
I've
 
hired
 
the
 
AI
 
company
 
for
 
multiple
 
reasons.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
will
 
help
 
our
 
contact
 
rate.

You
 
know,
 
we
 
get
 
in
 
touch
 
with
 
them
 
quicker
 
is
 
when
 
I
 
can
 
access
 
that
 
into
 
the
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
because
 
the
 
AI
 
can
 
actually
 
do
 
everything
 
in
 
Tebra,
 
too.
 
So
 
we'll
 
doing
 
everything
 
simultaneously.

The
 
only
 
thing
 
it
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
the
 
credit
 
card.
 
And
 
that's
 
still
 
the
 
problem.
 
And
 
they
 
said
 
that
 
is.
 
It's
 
from
 
a,
 
I
 
guess
 
it's
 
a
 
legal
 
thing
 
with
 
AI
 
or
 
something.
 
They're
 
having
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
figure
 
out
 
how
 
to
 
implement
 
that
 
down
 
the
 
road.
 
But
 
the
 
AI,
 
I
 
told
 
them
 
to
 
keep
 
it
 
all
 
HIPAA
 
compliant
 
so
 
that
 
AI
 
can
 
ask
 
more
 
health-based
 
questions.
 
A
 
few
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
I've
 
seen,
 
they
 
showed
 
up,
 
but
 
they
 
weren't
 
medically
 
appropriate.
 
They
 
had
 
a
 
brain
 
aneurysm
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
So
 
they
 
had
 
an
 
aortic
 
or
 
an
 
aortic
 
aneurysm,
 
or
 
one
 
of
 
them
 
was
 
bipolar,
 
you
 
know,
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
So
 
the
 
AI,
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
ask
 
more
 
of
 
those
 
detailed
 
questions
 
and
 
keep
 
it
 
recorded
 
in
 
the
 
HIPAA
 
compliant
 
AI
 
thing
 
will
 
help.
 
I
 
think
 
weed
 
out
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
bad
 
leads.
 
I
 
know
 
it'll
 
help
 
our
 
call
 
rates
 
anyway,
 
for
 
sure.
 
That'll
 
get
 
back
 
to
 
them
 
really
 
quick.
 
And
 
I
 
told
 
them
 
that
 
once
 
we
 
get
 
this
 
inbound
 
call
 
thing
 
set
 
up,
 
which
 
they
 
said
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
week,
 
it
 
was
 
done
 
last
 
week,
 
but
 
I
 
found
 
so
 
many
 
hiccups
 
with
 
it,
 
so
 
they
 
went
 
back
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
fix
 
some
 
stuff.
 
But
 
once
 
I...
 
I've
 
got
 
the
 
inbound
 
stuff.
 
Good.
 
That's
 
the
 
next
 
thing
 
I'm
 
having
 
them
 
work
 
on,
 
is
 
to
 
link
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
this
 
stuff
 
and
 
start
 
making
 
outbound
 
calls.

Okay.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
set.
 
So
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
did
 
we
 
have
 
coming
 
inside
 
up
 
until
 
now?
 
How
 
many
 
people
 
did
 
you
 
see
 
in
 
the
 
clinic?
 
or
 
Paula?

Let
 
me

@11:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Because
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
it's
 
not
 
updated.
 
Also,
 
like,
 
there's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
things
 
that,
 
like,
 
more
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over.
 
 
@11:30
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah.
 
The
 
front
 
desk,
 
that's
 
something
 
I've
 
noticed,
 
too,
 
is
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
getting
 
your
 
notifications
 
of,
 
like,
 
has
 
this
 
person
 
been
 
seen
 
or
 
whatever,
 
I
 
was
 
having
 
to
 
go
 
there
 
and,
 
like,
 
kind
 
of
 
backtrack,
 
putting
 
them
 
as
 
scheduled
 
or
 
canceled
 
because
 
the
 
systems
 
don't
 
talk
 
to
 
each
 
other.
 
And
 
when
 
the
 
front
 
desk
 
is
 
flowing
 
that
 
quickly,
 
and
 
you
 
got
 
people
 
coming
 
in
 
and
 
out,
 
like,
 
I
 
get
 
where
 
the
 
front
 
desk
 
is
 
dropping
 
the
 
ball
 
on
 
that.
 
But
 
we've
 
got
 
to
 
figure
 
out
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
fix
 
that.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
AI
 
will
 
help
 
us
 
eliminate
 
that.
 
As
 
well,
 
because
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
both
 
simultaneously.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
having
 
to
 
spend
 
more
 
money,
 
but
 
ultimately,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
maybe
 
it'll
 
help.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
know
 
it'll
 
help
 
with
 
patient
 
satisfaction
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
hold
 
of
 
us,
 
but,
 
you
 
know,
 
having
 
a
 
computer
 
take
 
over
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
roles
 
where
 
the
 
people
 
are
 
dropping
 
the
 
ball,
 
I
 
think
 
that'll
 
help
 
a
 
little
 
bit.

Okay,
 
so
 
can
 
you,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
the

of
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
showed
 
up?
 
 
@12:30

I
 
just
 
had
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
see
 
because
 
it's
 
extremely
 
important.
 
I'm
 
getting
 
it
 
pulled
 
up
 
here.
 
Hang
 
on.
 
I
 
will
 
tell
 
you
 
something
 
Melissa
 
pointed
 
out
 
today,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
problem
 
and
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
fix
 
it,
 
is
 
the
 
widget
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
use.
 
I
 
turned
 
on
 
her
 
online
 
scheduling
 
as
 
a
 
therapist
 
for
 
her
 
patients.
 
Her
 
provider
 
profile,
 
well,
 
when
 
the
 
people
 
are
 
now
 
clicking
 
on
 
the
 
widget
 
for
 
us,
 
for
 
the
 
Facebook
 
ads,
 
it
 
also
 
pulls
 
her
 
up,
 
and
 
so
 
they're
 
selecting
 
her
 
as
 
well,
 
and
 
she
 
doesn't
 
have
 
the
 
license,
 
the
 
medical
 
compliance,
 
I
 
guess
 
would
 
be
 
the
 
word,
 
to
 
actually
 
dictate
 
if
 
they
 
can
 
or
 
cannot
 
have
 
that.
 
So
 
now
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
back
 
and
 
reschedule
 
those
 
people
 
because
 
they
 
can't
 
see
 
Melissa
 
for
 
that.
 
 
@13:26

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
They
 
can
 
see
 
her
 
for
 
therapy,
 
but
 
not
 
for
 
medication
 
stuff.
 
So
 
where
 
do
 
they
 
see
 
that,
 
again?
 
You
 
said
 
on
 
Facebook,
 
specifically,
 
is
 
it
 
from
 
the
 
ads,
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
something
 
like,
 
where
 
do
 
they
 
see
 
that?
 
 
@13:37
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
It's
 
the
 
widget.
 
It's
 
that
 
link
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
schedule
 
directly.
 
 
@13:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
you
 
mean
 
the
 
Tebra
 
link?
 
 
@13:43
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
The
 
Tebra
 
link,
 
yes.
 
I
 
did
 
not
 
know
 
that
 
because
 
that
 
is
 
apparently
 
the
 
same
 
widget
 
or
 
link
 
that
 
our
 
provider
 
profiles
 
through
 
Tebra
 
have
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
book
 
with
 
us.
 
When
 
they
 
click
 
on
 
that
 
link,
 
they
 
can
 
go
 
search
 
the
 
provider,
 
times,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
but
 
I
 
did
 
not
 
realize
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
put
 
Melissa.
 
On
 
that
 
link
 
as
 
well.
 
I
 
thought
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
separate
 
entity
 
when
 
I
 
turned
 
it
 
on
 
for
 
her
 
profile,
 
but
 
it's
 
not.
 
It's
 
the
 
exact
 
same
 
link.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
let
 
me
 
pull
 
up
 
–
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
just
 
do
 
August
 
real
 
quick.
 
 
@14:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Is
 
it
 
–
 
how
 
many
 
–
 
is
 
there
 
–
 
I
 
saw
 
that
 
there's
 
one
 
that
 
wants
 
to
 
start.
 
Are
 
there
 
more
 
than
 
that,
 
or
 
is
 
there
 
–
 
Honestly,
 
no.
 
 
@14:24
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
So
 
we've
 
converted
 
one
 
that
 
has
 
started.
 
Amber
 
Forrest
 
has
 
started.
 
She
 
was
 
a
 
Facebook
 
ad.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
–
 
I
 
see
 
Lauren.
 
One
 
for
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
that
 
I've
 
seen.
 
Paula,
 
she's
 
with
 
Patience.
 
 
@14:44
 
-
 
Audreyanna
 
I'll
 
have
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
her
 
thing
 
here
 
in
 
a
 
second.
 
We're
 
still
 
working
 
on
 
Lauren's
 
too.
 
 
@14:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
–
 
okay.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
Amber
 
Forrest,
 
which
 
she
 
started.
 
She
 
started.
 
 
@14:54
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
That's
 
good.
 
Carpenter,
 
that's
 
her
 
last
 
name.
 
She
 
is
 
–
 
we're
 
working
 
on
 
her.
 
Trying
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
her
 
insurance
 
will
 
pay
 
for
 
it
 
because
 
she
 
has
 
like
 
an
 
Indian
 
reservation
 
type
 
insurance.
 
And
 
then
 
Laura
 
Pfeiffer
 
had
 
straight
 
Arkansas
 
Medicaid,
 
which
 
is
 
always
 
going
 
be
 
the
 
hardest
 
one
 
to
 
get.
 
And
 
we
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
hers,
 
but
 
she
 
is
 
gung
 
ho
 
and
 
ready
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
it
 
approved.
 
 
@15:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
awesome.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
Amber,
 
Laura,
 
which
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
done
 
with.
 
 
@15:24
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
another
 
one.
 
What's
 
her
 
name?
 
What's
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
last
 
one?
 
 
@15:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Sarah
 
Carpenter.
 
Sarah
 
Carpenter.
 
Okay.
 
Is
 
it
 
Sarah
 
with
 
an
 
H
 
or?
 
 
@15:33
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yes.
 
 
@15:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
With
 
an
 
H.
 
Let's
 
see.
 
Let's
 
see
 
Sarah
 
Roofer.
 
Nope.
 
That's
 
just
 
a
 
carpenter.
 
That's
 
weird.
 
 
@15:44
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I
 
Timber
 
is
 
garbage.
 
And
 
that
 
is
 
something
 
else,
 
man.
 
Even
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
put
 
some
 
stuff
 
on
 
hold
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
get
 
this
 
to
 
work
 
smoother,
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
down
 
the
 
road
 
we
 
got.
 
I've
 
been
 
talking
 
to
 
several
 
EMR
 
systems.
 
My
 
staff
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
find
 
out
 
right
 
now
 
that
 
we
 
will
 
probably...
 
I'm
 
probably
 
switching
 
that
 
all
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
year
 
because
 
I'm
 
just
 
–
 
I'm
 
fed
 
up
 
with
 
them.
 
 
@16:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
understand.
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
should
 
definitely
 
switch
 
them.
 
It's
 
unbelievable,
 
like
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
–
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
gives
 
the
 
biggest
 
red
 
flag
 
is
 
not
 
even
 
a
 
red
 
flag.
 
It's
 
just
 
unbelievable
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
book
 
with
 
Melissa
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
widget.
 
 
@16:20
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
It's
 
just
 
–
 
So
 
just
 
for
 
an
 
example,
 
like
 
even
 
taking
 
all
 
this
 
other
 
stuff
 
out
 
of
 
consideration,
 
the
 
customer
 
service
 
is
 
awful.
 
I
 
sent
 
in
 
a
 
request
 
for
 
help
 
last
 
Tuesday
 
for
 
something,
 
and
 
they
 
just
 
got
 
back
 
to
 
me
 
yesterday.
 
That's
 
not
 
acceptable.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@16:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Help
 
me.
 
I
 
cannot
 
even
 
see
 
Sarah
 
here,
 
which
 
is
 
weird.
 
 
@16:44
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Now,
 
she
 
may
 
not
 
–
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
she
 
–
 
she
 
may
 
not
 
have
 
ever
 
linked
 
–
 
booked
 
through
 
this,
 
but
 
she
 
found
 
us
 
through
 
a
 
Facebook
 
ad.
 
 
@16:51
 
-
 
Audreyanna
 
So
 
I'm
 
adding
 
her.
 
I'm
 
counting
 
her
 
in.
 
Sarah
 
didn't
 
–
 
she
 
didn't
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
link.
 
 
@16:54
 
-
 
Ryleigh
 
No,
 
Sarah
 
called.
 
 
@16:57
 
-
 
Audreyanna
 
She
 
called.
 
 
@16:58
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
She
 
didn't
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
link.
 
Okay,
 
okay.
 
Okay.
 
How
 
did
 
she
 
find
 
out
 
about
 
us?
 
 
@17:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Do
 
you
 
remember?
 
 
@17:04
 
-
 
Audreyanna
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
She
 
just
 
came.
 
I
 
think
 
she
 
called
 
and
 
booked
 
an
 
appointment,
 
but
 
she
 
didn't
 
go
 
to
 
Queens.
 
 
@17:12
 
-
 
Ryleigh
 
She
 
said
 
her
 
friend
 
was
 
on
 
Spravado
 
and
 
she
 
was
 
like
 
searching
 
about
 
nearest
 
Spravado
 
locations
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
were
 
the
 
one.
 
 
@17:19
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Oh,
 
okay.
 
Then
 
she
 
found
 
us.
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
Let's
 
see.
 
Note
 
that
 
one's
 
here
 
for
 
appointments.
 
got
 
one.
 
 
@17:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Nope.
 
That's
 
an
 
appointment.
 
So
 
how
 
many
 
appointments
 
do
 
we
 
have
 
set
 
and
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
showed
 
up
 
in
 
August
 
in
 
general?
 
 
@17:38
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Well,
 
let's
 
just,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
pull
 
it
 
up.
 
So
 
some
 
of
 
those,
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
are
 
my
 
pre
 
like
 
previously
 
standing
 
clients
 
that
 
are
 
just
 
coming
 
in
 
for
 
treatments.
 
I'm
 
looking.
 
that
 
Hmm.
 
Okay.
 
I've
 
seen
 
lots
 
of
 
counseling
 
sessions.
 
Somebody's
 
doing
 
something
 
for
 
it.
 
 
@18:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
what,
 
didn't
 
hear
 
what
 
you
 
said?
 
Counseling.
 
Oh,
 
canceling.
 
 
@18:06
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay.
 
Yeah.
 
Was
 
the
 
first
 
of
 
August
 
when
 
Paula
 
was
 
out
 
sick
 
a
 
lot?
 
Guys,
 
do
 
y'all
 
know?
 
 
@18:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
definitely
 
don't
 
know.
 
No,
 
no,
 
yeah,
 
you
 
know.
 
 
@18:26
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay,
 
here
 
we
 
go.
 
A
 
couple
 
of
 
evaluations.
 
So
 
Angela
 
Cheatham,
 
she
 
was
 
one
 
through
 
there.
 
She
 
did
 
not
 
qualify
 
because
 
she's
 
not
 
tried
 
enough
 
medications,
 
and
 
I
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
get
 
that
 
approved
 
through
 
her
 
Facebook.
 
This
 
one
 
rescheduled.
 
 
@18:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
she
 
was
 
basically
 
in
 
charge.
 
she
 
was
 
excluded.
 
 
@18:51
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah,
 
she
 
said
 
she
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
stay
 
and
 
stay
 
a
 
patient.
 
We
 
could
 
keep
 
working
 
on
 
like
 
just
 
other
 
meds
 
and
 
try
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
converter
 
once
 
we
 
could,
 
but
 
she
 
never
 
showed
 
back
 
up
 
for
 
a
 
follow
 
up.
 
So
 
Laura
 
Pfeiffer
 
came
 
in.
 
So
 
that's
 
one
 
of
 
ones
 
we've
 
already
 
talked
 
about.
 
Devin
 
Williams
 
came
 
in.
 
So
 
she
 
actually
 
agreed.
 
We
 
went
 
through
 
all
 
the
 
stuff.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
new
 
one.
 
 
@19:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
However,
 
she
 
called
 
us
 
last
 
week
 
and
 
said
 
she's
 
going
 
to
 
hold
 
off.
 
So
 
Devin,
 
I
 
can't
 
even
 
see
 
Devin.
 
Did
 
I
 
write
 
it
 
right?
 
 
@19:22
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Hang
 
on
 
a
 
minute.
 
D-E-V-I-N
 
Williams.
 
It
 
looks
 
like
 
she
 
booked
 
the
 
widget,
 
too.
 
Yeah.
 
 
@19:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it's
 
interesting
 
where
 
she
 
booked
 
it
 
from
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
it
 
here.
 
 
@19:38
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay.
 
Tony
 
Pruitt
 
booked
 
for
 
that.
 
 
@19:45
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Tony
 
Pruitt.
 
 
@19:46
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Oh,
 
there
 
he
 
is.
 
So
 
he
 
was
 
ruled
 
out
 
because
 
he
 
has
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
contraindications.
 
 
@19:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
he's
 
basically
 
disqualified.
 
 
@19:57
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah,
 
he's
 
disqualified.
 
So.
 
So.
 
So.
 
So.
 
So.
 
So.
 
 
@20:10
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
do
 
a
 
little
 
analysis
 
here.
 
When
 
Tiffany
 
didn't
 
show,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
was
 
credit
 
card
 
taken?
 
And
 
second
 
of
 
all,
 
when
 
was
 
she
 
scheduled
 
for?
 
Like
 
how
 
long
 
from
 
the
 
phone
 
call
 
was
 
she
 
scheduled
 
for?
 
Do
 
you
 
guys
 
remember?
 
 
@20:32
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I'm
 
looking
 
on
 
my
 
side
 
of
 
it.
 
Who
 
am
 
I
 
looking
 
up?
 
Tiffany
 
Franks?
 
So
 
she
 
was
 
scheduled
 
for
 
August
 
the
 
7th.
 
 
@20:43
 
-
 
Ryleigh
 
I
 
think
 
she
 
was
 
scheduled
 
before
 
we
 
started
 
taking
 
cards.
 
 
@20:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
how
 
long
 
after
 
did
 
you
 
schedule
 
for?
 
 
@20:51
 
-
 
Ryleigh
 
Like
 
how
 
many
 
days
 
after?
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure.
 
 
@20:58
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Was
 
it
 
the
 
same
 
week
 
or
 
was
 
it
 
after?
 
 
@21:00
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
That's
 
the
 
question.
 
It
 
was
 
probably
 
after
 
that
 
week.
 
Because
 
that
 
was
 
before
 
we
 
started
 
implementing
 
everything.
 
 
@21:08
 
-
 
Ryleigh
 
Yeah.
 
 
@21:10
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay.
 
Demographics.
 
 
@21:13
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
can't
 
even
 
find
 
it.
 
 
@21:15
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Demographics,
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
card,
 
or
 
what's
 
the
 
card
 
under?
 
 
@21:21
 
-
 
Ryleigh
 
It
 
should
 
be
 
demographics
 
or
 
account,
 
I
 
think.
 
then,
 
like,
 
no,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
demographics
 
and
 
then
 
payment
 
info,
 
I
 
believe.
 
Or
 
that's
 
account,
 
one
 
of
 
those.
 
 
@21:38
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
collect
 
payment
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
pulls
 
up.
 
Yeah,
 
no
 
card
 
on
 
file.
 
So
 
she
 
was
 
one
 
of
 
ones
 
before
 
we
 
started
 
trying
 
to
 
implement
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
I'll
 
keep
 
looking
 
through
 
here.
 
Yeah,
 
Helena
 
Newsome.
 
No-showed,
 
Angela
 
Boll,
 
no-showed,
 
Elena.

Did
 
I
 
write
 
it
 
right?
 
 
@22:09
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Because
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
her,
 
too.
 
H-E-L-E-N-A,
 
Newsome.
 
 
@22:14

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Did
 
I?
 
Oh,
 
no.
 
Okay,
 
I
 
did
 
a
 
double.
 
Yeah,
 
she
 
also
 
is
 
not
 
here
 
for
 
some
 
reason.
 
That
 
is
 
so
 
weird.
 
Like,
 
where
 
are
 
they
 
coming
 
from?
 
That's
 
the
 
question.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
there's
 
a...
 
Oh,
 
there
 
she
 
is.
 
That's
 
weird.
 
 
@22:30
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah.
 
so
 
we
 
moved
 
her
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
show.
 
So
 
she's
 
on
 
there
 
twice.
 
Okay.
 
 
@22:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Um...
 
Interesting.
 
 
@22:37

Schantz

Let's
 
see...
 
 
@22:39
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
she
 
came
 
in
 
on
 
August
 
10th.
 
 
@22:41
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
When
 
was
 
she
 
booked
 
for?
 
Uh...
 
She
 
was
 
booked
 
for
 
820...
 
822?
 
No,
 
I'm
 
sorry.
 
That's
 
her
 
birthday.
 
 
@22:56

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Hang
 
on
 
just
 
a
 
second.
 
 
@22:59
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Hang
 
on.
 
Uh...
 
820...
 
 
@23:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
that's
 
a
 
major
 
problem
 
that
 
we
 
have.
 
We
 
are
 
not,
 
like,
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
everything
 
possible
 
to
 
optimize
 
for
 
the
 
closest
 
date
 
possible.
 
Closest
 
date
 
possible
 
because
 
the
 
chances
 
of
 
people,
 
and
 
it's
 
like
 
proven
 
by
 
studies
 
and
 
everything,
 
the
 
chances
 
of
 
people
 
showing
 
up
 
if
 
you
 
book
 
them
 
after
 
just
 
four
 
days
 
is
 
unbelievable.
 
Like,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
it,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
an
 
example
 
for
 
a
 
client
 
of
 
mine
 
that's
 
not
 
even
 
a
 
clinic.
 
He
 
runs
 
webinars,
 
okay,
 
live
 
events.
 
We
 
run,
 
we
 
do
 
a
 
webinar
 
every
 
single
 
week,
 
okay,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
budget
 
running
 
from
 
Monday,
 
okay,
 
because
 
Monday
 
is
 
the
 
live
 
event.
 
So
 
we
 
run
 
Tuesday,
 
Wednesday,
 
Thursday,
 
and
 
Friday,
 
and
 
80%
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
sign
 
up
 
are
 
people
 
that
 
signed
 
up
 
on
 
Friday,
 
Saturday,
 
and
 
Sunday.
 
So
 
we're
 
not
 
going
 
be
 
up
 
to
 
Tuesday,
 
And
 
Friday
 
are
 
not
 
coming
 
because
 
there's
 
such
 
a
 
long
 
gap
 
and
 
people
 
are
 
so
 
busy
 
and
 
their
 
memory
 
is
 
so
 
short
 
that
 
they're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 
Also,
 
the
 
pain
 
in
 
which
 
they're
 
at
 
when
 
they
 
sign
 
up
 
for
 
the
 
ad
 
is
 
the
 
highest.
 
Two
 
weeks
 
after,
 
life
 
goes
 
by,
 
they
 
don't
 
really
 
see
 
our
 
ads
 
anymore,
 
and
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
nurture
 
sequence
 
for
 
two
 
weeks,
 
which
 
makes
 
it
 
basically
 
impossible
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
keep
 
them
 
warm
 
and
 
keep
 
them
 
intact
 
with
 
what
 
they're
 
doing.
 
And
 
also,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
take
 
into
 
consideration
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
dealing
 
with
 
depression,
 
which
 
makes
 
them
 
even
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
actually
 
take
 
action.
 
So,
 
girls,
 
the
 
main
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
for
 
is
 
when
 
you
 
see
 
a
 
booking,
 
like
 
optimize
 
for
 
the
 
closest
 
booking
 
possible
 
on
 
the
 
calendar
 
that
 
is
 
available
 
for
 
either
 
Schantz
 
or
 
Paula.
 
 
@24:49
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
And
 
also…
 
So
 
if
 
they're
 
doing
 
that,
 
even
 
if
 
they're
 
booking
 
through
 
the
 
widget,
 
because
 
that's
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
problems,
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
show
 
the
 
most
 
optimal
 
appointment
 
because
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
show
 
what's
 
first
 
available.
 
So,
 
like
 
if
 
they're
 
clicking,
 
you
 
know,
 
two
 
weeks…
 
That's
 
what's
 
showing
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
widget.
 
When
 
our
 
girls
 
call
 
them,
 
hey,
 
would
 
you
 
like
 
something
 
closer
 
because
 
we
 
can
 
fit
 
you
 
in
 
at
 
this
 
date?
 
ACTION
 
ITEM:
 
Brainstorm
 
incentives
 
for
 
patients
 
to
 
book
 
earlier
 
appointments.
 
Note
 
ideas
 
in
 
calendar.
 
-
 
WATCH
 
Because
 
I
 
can
 
double
 
book
 
for
 
my
 
Spravato
 
treatment.
 
So
 
even
 
though
 
it's
 
showing
 
closed,
 
I
 
can
 
still
 
squeeze
 
in
 
another
 
patient
 
at
 
that
 
time
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
with
 
the
 
patients
 
the
 
entire
 
time.

Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
That's
 
perfect.
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that.
 
We
 
should
 
do
 
that.
 
And
 
also,
 
we
 
should
 
also
 
give
 
them
 
an
 
incentive.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
like
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
a
 
brainstorming
 
thing
 
now.
 
What
 
kind
 
of
 
thing
 
can
 
we
 
give
 
them
 
as
 
an
 
incentive
 
to
 
come
 
earlier
 
instead
 
of
 
two
 
weeks
 
out?
 
Is
 
there
 
anything
 
that
 
we
 
could
 
give
 
them?
 
It
 
doesn't
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
something
 
that
 
costs
 
you
 
guys
 
money.
 
just
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
something
 
that
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
perceived
 
as
 
valuable
 
to
 
them.
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@25:51
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
That's
 
a
 
good
 
question.
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
a
 
free
 
consultation,
 
but
 
then
 
I
 
start
 
getting
 
into
 
the
 
liability
 
of
 
like
 
Medicare,
 
Medicaid.
 
Because
 
if
 
I
 
do
 
it
 
for
 
one
 
type
 
of
 
person,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
for
 
all.
 
Let
 
me
 
think
 
on
 
that
 
one.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
on
 
that
 
one
 
for
 
sure.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
That's
 
like,
 
this
 
is,
 
take
 
like
 
an
 
hour
 
today,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion,
 
and
 
like
 
write
 
that
 
down
 
in
 
your
 
notes

Just
 
sit
 
down
 
and
 
understand
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
do.
 
 
@26:25
 
-
 
Melissa.
 
Let
 
me
 
do
 
it.
 
We'll
 
put
 
them
 
on

with
 
me.

Melissa,
 
actually.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
bring
 
it

okay?
 
Okay,
 
I'm
 
going

If
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
the
 
criteria
 
to
 
diagnose
 
the
 
major
 
depression,
 
treatment
 
resistant,
 
you
 
can
 
at
 
least
 
say
 
yes
 
or
 
no,
 
you're
 
a
 
possible
 
candidate.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
you
 
to
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
med
 
providers.
 
 
@26:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
way
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
them
 
in
 
faster.
 
Okay,
 
Speed
 
guys.
 
 
@27:00

Melissa.

@27:00

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
cannot
 
hear
 
you.
 
 
@27:02
 
-
 
Melissa.
 
Wait.
 
Can
 
you
 
hear
 
me?
 
 
@27:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Some
 
Zoom
 
technical
 
difficulty
 
session
 
for
 
a
 
second.
 
Let
 
me
 
see.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
Speak.
 
 
@27:13
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay.
 
 
@27:14
 
-
 
Melissa.
 
Well,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
a
 
mental
 
health
 
therapist.
 
I
 
could
 
always
 
do,
 
I
 
mean,
 
honestly,
 
I'd
 
still
 
like
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
90791,
 
though,
 
but
 
so
 
it'd
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
at
 
least
 
50
 
minutes,
 
but
 
we
 
can
 
tailor
 
the
 
questions
 
around
 
that,
 
maybe.
 
 
@27:29
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
she
 
can
 
technically
 
do
 
a
 
psychiatric
 
evaluation.
 
She
 
just
 
doesn't
 
have
 
the
 
medical
 
exam
 
part.
 
So
 
she
 
could
 
give
 
them
 
the
 
diagnosis
 
of
 
treatment
 
resistant
 
major
 
depression.
 
So
 
kind
 
of
 
get
 
a
 
partial
 
evaluation
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
way
 
and
 
get
 
them
 
established
 
with
 
care
 
faster
 
if
 
they
 
go
 
with
 
her.
 
And
 
in
 
that
 
way,
 
it's
 
only
 
like
 
a
 
30
 
minute
 
appointment
 
with
 
us
 
to
 
come
 
back
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
finish
 
getting
 
them
 
approved
 
for
 
Spravato.
 
 
@27:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
That's
 
cool.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
that,
 
this
 
is,
 
this
 
is
 
perfect.
 
This
 
applies.
 
Okay.
 
do
 
So
 
very
 
important
 
to
 
implement
 
that.
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
way
 
that,
 
girls,
 
is
 
there
 
any
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
implement
 
that?
 
Because
 
this
 
is,
 
for
 
me,
 
okay,
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
thing
 
to
 
optimize
 
for.
 
The
 
most
 
important
 
thing.
 
Because
 
it
 
keeps
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
ballpark
 
of
 
them
 
having
 
the
 
pain
 
and
 
being
 
excited
 
to,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
they
 
left
 
their
 
details,
 
they
 
read
 
through
 
our
 
long
 
ad
 
and
 
watched
 
three
 
minute
 
video
 
of
 
an
 
ad
 
because
 
they
 
resonate
 
with
 
the
 
pain.
 
They
 
submitted
 
the
 
form
 
on
 
the
 
landing
 
page
 
because
 
they
 
resonated
 
with
 
the
 
pain.
 
They
 
booked
 
themselves
 
on
 
the
 
widget
 
because
 
they
 
resonated,
 
because
 
they
 
really
 
do
 
need
 
help.
 
So
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
keep
 
them
 
warm
 
and
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
come
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible.
 
 
@28:44

Schantz
 
Flores
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
important.
 
That's
 
a,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
was
 
ruling
 
it
 
out
 
because
 
she
 
can't
 
prescribe
 
the
 
medication,
 
but
 
we
 
could
 
get
 
them
 
in
 
faster
 
by
 
doing
 
that,
 
by
 
keeping
 
them
 
seeing
 
Melissa
 
and
 
the
 
girls,
 
Adriana
 
and
 
Ryleigh,
 
when
 
they
 
talked
 
to
 
them.
 
Even
 
if
 
they're
 
scheduled
 
with
 
me
 
or
 
Paula,
 
I
 
hey,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
know
 
you're
 
scheduled
 
this
 
far
 
out
 
to
 
see
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
med
 
providers,
 
but
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
you
 
in
 
quicker
 
and
 
start
 
the
 
process
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
come
 
see
 
Melissa,
 
who's
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
therapists,
 
and
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
keep
 
seeing
 
her
 
because
 
they
 
may
 
have
 
their
 
own
 
therapist,
 
but
 
she
 
can
 
at
 
least
 
do
 
the,
 
that's
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
people
 
ask
 
me
 
is
 
like,
 
can
 
I
 
keep
 
seeing
 
my
 
own
 
provider?
 
Well,
 
yes,
 
you
 
can,
 
because
 
all
 
we
 
are
 
is
 
a
 
treatment
 
center.
 
So,
 
you
 
know,
 
making
 
it
 
clear
 
with
 
them
 
that
 
Melissa
 
is
 
not
 
taking
 
the
 
place
 
of
 
their
 
current
 
therapist.

That's
 
perfect.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
like
 
the
 
number
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
implement
 
from
 
now
 
on
 
for
 
all
 
new
 
leads.

Melissa
 
has
 
the
 
time.
 
So
 
we've
 
definitely
 
got

to
 
fill.

Okay,
 
that's
 
perfect.
 
That's
 
what
 
we
 
want.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
girls,
 
please
 
note
 
that
 
extremely
 
important.
 
You
 
guys
 
are
 
doing
 
a
 
good
 
job,
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
job
 
with
 
booking
 
people.
 
Our
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
is
 
great.
 
I
 
see
 
what
 
you
 
guys
 
are
 
doing.
 
With
 
the
 
follow-ups,
 
just
 
implement
 
this
 
one
 
extra
 
thing
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
now,
 
you
 
know,
 
just
 
to
 
make
 
things
 
way
 
better.
 
In
 
the
 
end,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
get
 
as
 
many
 
patients
 
as
 
possible.

I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
clear
 
for
 
both
 
of
 
the
 
girls
 
at
 
the
 
front
 
and
 
Melissa
 
that
 
when
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
this
 
AI
 
figured
 
out
 
and
 
I
 
get
 
it
 
running
 
smooth,
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
help
 
significantly
 
with
 
our
 
callback
 
time
 
and
 
our
 
booking
 
rates
 
to
 
where,
 
Melissa,
 
you
 
may
 
not
 
have
 
any
 
openings
 
within
 
three
 
months.

All
 
right,
 
so,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
Helena,
 
which
 
for
 
some
 
reason
 
doesn't
 
show
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
opportunity.
 
I
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
why
 
she
 
doesn't
 
show
 
there,
 
but,
 
okay,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
her,
 
which
 
we
 
understand
 
why
 
she
 
didn't
 
show.
 
You
 
guys
 
can
 
do,
 
like,
 
I
 
do
 
recommend
 
you
 
guys
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
all
 
the
 
no-shows
 
that
 
we
 
had
 
in
 
August,
 
make
 
a
 
list
 
out
 
of
 
it,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
just
 
call
 
them.
 
Call
 
them,
 
ask
 
them
 
if
 
they
 
want
 
Come
 
back
 
in
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
good
 
time,
 
obviously
 
for
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
didn't
 
show
 
up
 
and
 
didn't
 
talk,
 
because
 
if
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
call
 
them
 
from
 
the
 
local
 
phone
 
number,
 
they're
 
probably
 
not
 
even
 
going
 
to
 
remember.
 
Just
 
call
 
them,
 
say
 
hi.
 
You're
 
supposed
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
an
 
evaluation.
 
It
 
didn't
 
work
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
end.
 
We
 
wanted
 
to
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
wanted
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
week.
 
We
 
have
 
like
 
one
 
spot
 
available
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
week
 
on
 
this
 
Thursday,
 
and
 
we
 
wanted
 
to
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
it.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
book
 
them.
 
You
 
don't
 
even
 
need
 
to
 
book
 
these
 
guys
 
with
 
a
 
credit
 
card
 
just
 
because
 
they
 
already
 
no-showed,
 
or
 
you
 
can
 
try
 
that
 
out.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
guess
 
it
 
doesn't
 
really
 
matter.
 
 
@31:38
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Just
 
because
 
you
 
didn't
 
take
 
credit
 
card
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
they
 
may
 
be
 
way
 
more
 
resistant
 
to
 
it
 
the
 
second
 
time.
 
Yeah.
 
Hey,
 
and
 
for
 
your
 
records,
 
Oriel,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
because
 
we've
 
signed
 
a
 
BAA,
 
so
 
everything's
 
HIPAA
 
compliant.
 
I've
 
got
 
a
 
report
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
print
 
for
 
you
 
that
 
will
 
show
 
the
 
no-shows.
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Mm
 
And
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
actually
 
send
 
that
 
to
 
you
 
probably
 
–
 
is
 
Slack
 
HIPAA
 
compliant?

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea.
 
 
@32:08
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay.
 
I
 
know
 
my
 
email
 
is.
 
I
 
may
 
send
 
it
 
to
 
you
 
that
 
way
 
so
 
at
 
least
 
you
 
can
 
look
 
at
 
it
 
and
 
see.
 
Because
 
I'm
 
sitting
 
here
 
looking
 
at
 
it,
 
and
 
I'm
 
finding
 
even
 
more
 
no-shows
 
that
 
are
 
showing
 
up
 
on
 
our
 
thing
 
on
 
Google
 
or
 
GoHighLevel.
 
So
 
there's
 
several
 
that
 
aren't
 
showing
 
up.
 
There
 
are
 
several
 
that
 
have
 
rescheduled.
 
They've
 
got
 
new
 
insurance.
 
Their
 
insurance
 
changed.
 
They
 
lost
 
their
 
insurance.
 
We
 
had
 
one
 
lady
 
that
 
lived
 
in
 
Tennessee
 
and
 
didn't
 
realize
 
how
 
far
 
away
 
we
 
were.

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
she
 
got
 
the
 
ad
 
unless,
 
like
 
you
 
said,
 
she
 
was
 
driving
 
through
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
Yeah.
 
 
@32:43
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
That's
 
like
 
100%
 
what
 
happened.
 
There's
 
no
 
other
 
way.
 
 
@32:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So.
 
Yeah.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we've
 
had
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
shows
 
up
 
until
 
now.
 
We
 
had
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
shows.
 
From
 
what
 
I
 
understand,
 
we
 
had
 
like
 
seven
 
or
 
eight
 
shows,
 
correct?
 
We
 
got
 
four
 
people
 
disqualified.
 
got
 
four
 
So
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
do
 
we
 
have
 
booked
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
couple
 
of
 
days?
 
Did
 
it
 
look
 
promising?
 
Is
 
there
 
any
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
already
 
from
 
these
 
new
 
people,
 
if
 
they're
 
booked
 
out
 
for
 
the
 
9th
 
of
 
September
 
or
 
anything
 
later
 
than
 
that,
 
call
 
these
 
people
 
and
 
get
 
them
 
booked
 
in
 
earlier.
 
Let's
 
just
 
start
 
optimizing
 
for
 
that
 
and
 
implementing
 
that
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible.
 
 
@33:27
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yeah,
 
no,
 
we've
 
actually
 
got
 
six
 
leads
 
already
 
in
 
Tebra
 
this
 
morning
 
from
 
this
 
weekend,
 
and
 
several
 
of
 
them
 
were
 
already
 
booked
 
with
 
Melissa.
 
So
 
that's
 
worked
 
out
 
perfect.
 
A
 
couple
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
booked
 
with
 
me
 
that
 
are
 
out
 
like
 
next
 
week,
 
but
 
if
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
them
 
in
 
this
 
week,
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
even
 
better.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
send
 
you
 
this
 
list
 
and
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
run
 
a
 
report
 
just
 
for,
 
so
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
change
 
it
 
to
 
Spravato
 
evaluation,
 
so
 
that's
 
all
 
we
 
can
 
see.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
yeah.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
those
 
are
 
definitely
 
reasonable
 
options.
 
And
 
girls,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
is
 
Riley
 
still
 
on
 
here?
 
 
@34:00

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Where
 
did
 
she?
 
You
 
have
 
to
 
hop
 
off
 
while
 
she
 
was
 
driving.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
she's
 
not
 
here.
 
 
@34:06

Schantz
 
Flores
 
She
 
can
 
hear
 
you.
 
 
@34:08
 
-
 
Audreyanna
 
Okay,
 
okay.
 
Let
 
me
 
have
 
my
 
son
 
look
 
into
 
it.
 
 
@34:12

Schantz
 
Flores
 
He'll
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
little
 
rock
 
clinic
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to.
 
Okay,
 
that's
 
not
 
us.
 
Let's
 
see.
 
Okay,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
printed
 
off
 
one
 
just
 
strictly

vital
 
evaluation.

you

can

to
 
follow
 
back
 
up

Oriel

Yeah,
 
extremely
 
important.
 
In
 
my
 
eyes,
 
we
 
get
 
off
 
this
 
call,
 
first
 
thing
 
you
 
do
 
is
 
call
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
booked
 
more
 
than
 
five
 
days
 
ahead
 
and
 
try
 
to
 
book
 
them
 
for
 
this
 
week
 
for
 
what's
 
opened.
 
Like
 
that's
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
part,
 
like
 
the
 
new
 
leads
 
are
 
important,
 
but
 
you
 
know,
 
most
 
important
 
ones
 
are
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
booked
 
and
 
they're
 
booked
 
too
 
far
 
out.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
book
 
them
 
for
 
this
 
week,
 
give
 
them
 
an
 
incentive,
 
tell
 
them,
 
okay,
 
if
 
Schantz
 
is
 
not
 
available,
 
tell
 
them
 
to
 
book
 
with
 
Melissa.
 
Tell
 
them,
 
oh,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
this
 
provato.
 
Well,
 
We
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
faster,
 
and
 
we
 
got
 
a
 
spot
 
opened
 
up
 
for
 
you,
 
this
 
XYZ
 
on
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
spot
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
week,
 
and
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
help
 
you
 
faster.
 
Does
 
that
 
work?
 
Just,
 
you
 
know,
 
give
 
them
 
an
 
incentive
 
and
 
play
 
the
 
psychology
 
game.
 
Make
 
them
 
feel
 
like
 
it's
 
exclusive
 
and
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
something
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
like
 
a
 
one-time
 
thing.
 
Or
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
to
 
wait
 
another
 
week
 
and
 
a
 
half.
 
So
 
make
 
it,
 
like,
 
in
 
their
 
interest
 
to
 
feel
 
like
 
they
 
need
 
it,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
important.
 
It's
 
not
 
for
 
you
 
guys,
 
it's
 
for
 
them.
 
So
 
just
 
keep
 
that
 
in
 
mind.
 
Have
 
that
 
mindset
 
when
 
you
 
call
 
them.
 
And,
 
like,
 
the
 
first
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
do,
 
like,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
to
 
do,
 
but
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
when
 
we
 
get
 
off
 
the
 
call,
 
I
 
would
 
very
 
much
 
appreciate
 
that.
 
That's
 
going
 
to
 
help
 
us
 
all.
 
So,
 
great.
 
So
 
we
 
have,
 
what,
 
six
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
booked
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
couple
 
of
 
weeks,
 
or
 
was
 
it?
 
Yeah.
 
 
@35:56

Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay.
 
Yeah,
 
but
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
are
 
brand
 
new.
 
Now,
 
I
 
haven't
 
looked
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
many
 
are
 
already
 
on
 
the
 
schedule.

Those
 
are
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
are
 
new
 
just
 
from
 
this
 
weekend.
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
data
 
on
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
we
 
have
 
booked
 
in
 
general
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
couple
 
of
 
days?
 
 
@36:09

Schantz
 
Flores
 
Yes,
 
I'm
 
playing
 
with
 
my
 
list
 
right
 
now
 
trying
 
to
 
run
 
reports.

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
So
 
our
 
CPA
 
basically
 
seems
 
like
 
only
 
one
 
person
 
started.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
other
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
on
 
the
 
verge
 
of
 
it,
 
which
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
optimize,
 
obviously.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
more.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
booking
 
rate
 
a
 
bit
 
higher,
 
following
 
up
 
with
 
people
 
a
 
bit
 
more,
 
getting
 
the
 
booking,
 
getting
 
people
 
to
 
book
 
way
 
closer.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
things,
 
but
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
booking
 
is
 
good.
 
We
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
no-shows
 
up.
 
Like
 
the
 
no-shows
 
are
 
extremely
 
important
 
because
 
we
 
have
 
like
 
seven
 
no-shows
 
from
 
the
 
bookings,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
ideal.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it
 
makes
 
sense,
 
but
 
the
 
reasons
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
these
 
no-shows
 
is
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
circumstances
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
didn't
 
know
 
before.
 
So
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
fix
 
it
 
now,
 
optimize
 
and
 
get
 
better
 
because
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
do.
 
So...
 
Cool.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
Your
 
ads.
 
The
 
video
 
ads
 
are
 
working
 
extremely
 
well,
 
Schantz.
 
Like,
 
good
 
job
 
on
 
the
 
ads
 
that
 
you
 
filmed.
 
Hey,
 
y
 
making
 
fun
 
of
 
me.
 
I
 
thought
 
I
 
looked
 
pretty
 
good
 
in
 
that.
 
Come
 
on,
 
man.
 
No,
 
no,
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
good
 
video.
 
was
 
like,
 
do
 
you
 
remember?
 
 
@37:17
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I
 
was
 
basically
 
shitting
 
on
 
your
 
first
 
videos.
 
 
@37:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
But
 
you
 
improved
 
extremely
 
fast.
 
Like
 
the
 
final
 
videos,
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
damn,
 
he
 
got
 
it.
 
So
 
that's
 
great.
 
Cool.
 
So
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
continue
 
on
 
this
 
path
 
as
 
well.
 
can
 
also,
 
we
 
may
 
be
 
also
 
able
 
to
 
start
 
TikTok.
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
though.
 
They're
 
extremely
 
harsh
 
with
 
their
 
policies
 
and
 
everything.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
and
 
I'm
 
still
 
trying
 
to
 
fix
 
the
 
thing
 
with
 
the
 
pixel
 
because
 
that's
 
also
 
making
 
it
 
hard
 
for
 
us.
 
 
@37:48
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
What
 
is
 
that?
 
 
@37:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
problem
 
with
 
that?
 
I've
 
never
 
had
 
this
 
before.
 
I'm
 
very
 
surprised
 
that
 
it
 
actually
 
happened.
 
Like
 
they
 
have
 
like
 
data
 
restrictions
 
because
 
of
 
certain
 
data
 
that
 
we
 
send
 
back
 
to
 
Facebook.
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
it's
 
because
 
of
 
the.
 
And
 
the
 
questions
 
that
 
we
 
ask.
 
So
 
I
 
did
 
a
 
new
 
pixel.
 
It
 
wasn't
 
flagged
 
or
 
anything
 
yet.
 
And
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
that
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
it's
 
actually
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
flagged.
 
And
 
if
 
it
 
is,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
the
 
meta
 
service
 
team
 
and
 
everything
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
to
 
get
 
that
 
off
 
because
 
we
 
do
 
need
 
to
 
track
 
data.
 
It's
 
not
 
good
 
that
 
we're
 
not
 
optimizing.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
And
 
I'm
 
on
 
this
 
thing.
 
So,
 
okay.
 
 
@38:30
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
And
 
I
 
will
 
tell
 
you.
 
So,
 
and
 
also
 
when
 
I
 
say
 
I'm
 
taking
 
all
 
the
 
more
 
medical
 
questions
 
out
 
of
 
go
 
high
 
level,
 
like
 
I'm
 
still
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
full
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
AI
 
dashboards
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
see.
 
When
 
the
 
calls
 
are
 
made,
 
the
 
AIs
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
and
 
go
 
high
 
level,
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
if
 
they're
 
being
 
ruled
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
calls.
 
 
@38:48

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@38:49
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I'm
 
not
 
trying
 
to
 
hide
 
anything
 
from
 
you,
 
but
 
if
 
we're
 
going
 
get
 
more
 
in
 
depth
 
in
 
the
 
questions
 
we're
 
asking
 
on
 
the
 
phone,
 
then
 
I
 
need
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
HIPAA
 
compliant.
 
 
@38:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
So
 
a
 
question.
 
How
 
many.
 
How
 
much
 
did
 
the
 
AI
 
company
 
charge
 
you,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
it,
 
of
 
course?
 
 
@39:05
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
No,
 
that's
 
fine.
 
It's
 
$9.99
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
able
 
to
 
get.
 
Oh,
 
that's
 
it.
 
 
@39:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Are
 
they
 
good,
 
though?
 
 
@39:14
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I'll
 
let
 
you
 
know.
 
I
 
will
 
say
 
when
 
I
 
called
 
the
 
AI,
 
the
 
basic
 
version,
 
like
 
with
 
having
 
all
 
the
 
blanks
 
in
 
it
 
and
 
everything,
 
honestly,
 
was
 
really
 
scary
 
how
 
good
 
it
 
was.
 
I
 
let
 
a
 
pair
 
of
 
mine
 
listen
 
to
 
it
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
office
 
for
 
their
 
medical
 
clinic.
 
I
 
said,
 
hey,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
this
 
working
 
right,
 
maybe
 
y'all
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
and
 
cut
 
some
 
costs.
 
And
 
she
 
said,
 
that's
 
a
 
robot?
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
not
 
a
 
real
 
person.
 
But
 
it
 
was
 
really
 
clean.
 
And
 
then
 
just
 
even
 
with
 
the
 
tweaks
 
they've
 
made
 
so
 
far,
 
even
 
though
 
it's
 
not
 
perfect,
 
it's
 
really
 
good.
 
So,
 
and
 
it's
 
already
 
set
 
up
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
forward
 
to
 
like
 
a
 
call
 
center
 
if
 
they're
 
suicidal.
 
 
@39:54

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
didn't
 
hear
 
anything
 
that
 
you
 
said
 
because
 
my
 
internet
 
died
 
on
 
my
 
Wi-Fi
 
for
 
some
 
reason.
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
happened.
 
Sorry.
 
 
@40:02
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Okay.
 
So
 
they,
 
it
 
is
 
really
 
good.
 
I
 
called
 
the
 
basic
 
version
 
and
 
it
 
sounded
 
really
 
good,
 
even
 
having
 
all
 
the
 
stuff
 
wrong
 
with
 
it.
 
And
 
I
 
let
 
a
 
pair
 
of
 
mine
 
listen
 
to
 
it
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
could
 
use
 
it
 
for
 
their
 
medical
 
clinic.
 
And
 
they
 
were
 
really
 
impressed
 
with
 
just
 
the
 
basic
 
crap
 
version
 
because
 
it
 
sounded
 
so
 
much
 
like
 
a
 
real
 
person.
 
ACTION
 
ITEM:
 
Message
 
Sebastian
 
(AI
 
company).
 
Connect
 
him
 
with
 
Oriel
 
re:
 
potential
 
partnership.
 
-
 
WATCH
 
And
 
just
 
even
 
implementing
 
the
 
changes
 
specifically
 
for
 
my
 
clinic
 
and
 
things.
 
mean,
 
obviously
 
there
 
were
 
some
 
hiccups,
 
but
 
it's
 
really
 
good.
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
going
 
to,
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
going
 
work
 
out.
 
Okay.
 
Um,
 
so
 
we'll
 
see.
 
 
@40:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Cool.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
if
 
you,
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
send
 
me
 
the
 
number,
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
great
 
because
 
I'm
 
actually,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
invest
 
time
 
to
 
learn
 
the
 
voice
 
AI
 
on
 
my
 
own.
 
And
 
I
 
don't
 
really
 
have
 
a
 
company
 
that
 
I
 
actually
 
trust.
 
And
 
if
 
you're
 
saying
 
that
 
they're
 
good,
 
you
 
know,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
doing.
 
Like
 
you're
 
very
 
intuitive
 
with
 
tech
 
from
 
what
 
I've,
 
uh,
 
understood,
 
which
 
is
 
very
 
impressive.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
send
 
me
 
their
 
number,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
them,
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
have
 
a
 
potential
 
partnership
 
with
 
them
 
and
 
post
 
something
 
on.
 
 
@40:59
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I'm
 
100%.
 
Because
 
the
 
more
 
referrals
 
I
 
get,
 
I
 
can
 
potentially
 
get
 
it
 
for
 
free.
 
 
@41:04
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I'm
 
all
 
for
 
that,
 
man.
 
 
@41:07
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
That's
 
great.
 
 
@41:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
We
 
love
 
that.
 
 
@41:10
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
And
 
they
 
also
 
said,
 
I
 
talked
 
to
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
owners,
 
his
 
name's
 
Sebastian,
 
and
 
he
 
said
 
he's
 
used
 
GoHighLevel
 
and
 
implemented
 
it
 
for
 
like
 
over
 
five
 
years.
 
And
 
he's
 
a
 
previous
 
marketing
 
guy.
 
So
 
he
 
said
 
he's
 
very
 
familiar
 
with
 
it
 
and
 
made
 
sure
 
that
 
his
 
AI
 
could
 
implement
 
with
 
it
 
100%.
 
 
@41:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Is
 
it
 
a
 
$9.99
 
retainer,
 
basically,
 
that
 
you're
 
paying
 
them?
 
 
@41:31
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
It's
 
basically
 
a
 
subscription,
 
$9.99
 
a
 
month.
 
 
@41:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
Yeah,
 
because
 
I'm
 
really
 
debating
 
whether
 
to
 
hire,
 
because
 
I
 
do
 
want
 
for
 
other
 
clients
 
to
 
have,
 
because
 
not
 
all
 
clients
 
obviously
 
have
 
a
 
fundus
 
team,
 
which
 
is
 
also
 
good
 
in,
 
you
 
know,
 
following
 
up
 
with
 
what
 
we
 
have.
 
So
 
I
 
do
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
system
 
in
 
place
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
call
 
the
 
leads
 
and
 
everything,
 
and
 
I'm
 
just
 
debating,
 
because
 
it's
 
really
 
on
 
the
 
verge.
 
Voice
 
AI
 
is
 
really
 
on
 
the
 
verge
 
of
 
being
 
able
 
To
 
replace
 
humans.
 
Really
 
on
 
the
 
verge.
 
So
 
I'm
 
debating
 
whether
 
to
 
hire
 
somebody,
 
train
 
them,
 
pay
 
them
 
$1,000,
 
but
 
then
 
they
 
can
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
10
 
clients
 
or
 
just
 
implement
 
voice
 
AI
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
everything.
 
 
@42:14
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
This
 
voice
 
AI,
 
it's
 
scary.
 
I
 
let
 
my
 
hospital
 
staff
 
listen
 
to
 
it,
 
too.
 
And
 
my
 
secretary
 
over
 
there
 
said,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
replaced
 
in
 
five
 
years.
 
So,
 
I
 
mean,
 
it
 
was
 
that
 
good.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
I'll
 
get
 
with,
 
I
 
got
 
a
 
Slack
 
channel
 
with
 
Sebastian
 
as
 
well.
 
I'll
 
message
 
him
 
in
 
a
 
little
 
bit.
 
Because
 
like
 
I
 
said,
 
I
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
get
 
everybody
 
together
 
anyway
 
to
 
implement
 
it
 
for
 
this.
 
So
 
I'll
 
just
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
go
 
ahead
 
and
 
get
 
on
 
the
 
ball
 
early
 
and
 
get
 
you
 
guys
 
together.
 
 
@42:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
That's
 
great.
 
Okay.
 
Awesome.
 
So,
 
uh,
 
okay.
 
So
 
I
 
went
 
over
 
all
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
go.
 
I'm
 
glad
 
like
 
we
 
had,
 
uh,
 
honestly,
 
to
 
be
 
honest,
 
I
 
had
 
like
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
limiting
 
belief
 
before
 
we
 
went
 
on
 
the
 
call
 
was
 
like,
 
it's
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we're
 
like
 
analyzing
 
the
 
data.
 
Yeah.
 
They're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
good,
 
but
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
okay,
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing.
 
I've
 
done
 
this
 
like
 
7,000
 
times.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
different
 
because
 
the
 
clients
 
in
 
this
 
role
 
have
 
such
 
a
 
different
 
type
 
of
 
business
 
structure.
 
It's
 
not
 
a
 
clinic-wise.
 
It's
 
more
 
of
 
a
 
high-ticket
 
sales
 
thing
 
for
 
different
 
industries.
 
So
 
we
 
analyze
 
data
 
differently
 
there,
 
and
 
everything's
 
different.
 
But
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
okay,
 
let's
 
just
 
do
 
what
 
I
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
do,
 
and
 
that's
 
it.
 
And
 
that's
 
great.
 
So
 
we
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
optimize
 
for.
 
We
 
know
 
what
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
from
 
now
 
on
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
bookings.
 
The
 
lead
 
flow
 
is
 
good.
 
The
 
ads
 
are
 
working.
 
We
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
to
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
are
 
most
 
important.
 
That's
 
actually
 
getting
 
people
 
to
 
show
 
up
 
and
 
getting
 
more
 
volume
 
of
 
that
 
because
 
that's
 
the
 
most
 
important.
 
Without
 
that,
 
we're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
any
 
results.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
And
 
the
 
last
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
ask
 
is,
 
so
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
do
 
we
 
have
 
on
 
the
 
verge
 
of
 
joining?
 
Is
 
there,
 
like,
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
that
 
besides
 
Laura
 
and
 
Miss?
 
a
 
of
 
of
 
Is
 
of
 
Is
 
number
 
that?
 
 
@44:01
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Is
 
Is
 
Laura
 
and
 
Sarah,
 
both
 
of
 
those,
 
and
 
they're
 
both
 
initial
 
Medicaid,
 
but
 
they
 
both
 
have
 
a
 
secondary
 
insurance
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
kicking
 
in
 
at
 
some
 
point.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
could
 
convert
 
both
 
of
 
those
 
from
 
a
 
perspective
 
of
 
do
 
they
 
meet
 
criteria?
 
Yes,
 
they
 
both
 
meet
 
criteria
 
and
 
they
 
had
 
no
 
contraindications.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
I've
 
got
 
two
 
that
 
are
 
on
 
the
 
verge
 
of
 
it,
 
but
 
it's
 
a
 
battle
 
of
 
figuring
 
out
 
how
 
their
 
insurance
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
it.
 
So,
 
okay,
 
that's
 
cool.
 
 
@44:29

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Any
 
other
 
people
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
on
 
the
 
verge
 
or
 
that's
 
it?
 
 
@44:32
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
I've
 
got
 
one,
 
two,
 
three,
 
four,
 
five,
 
six,
 
seven,
 
eight,
 
eight
 
patients
 
scheduled
 
for
 
the
 
month
 
of
 
September
 
already
 
for
 
evaluations.
 
And
 
that's
 
just
 
what's
 
showing
 
up
 
on
 
my
 
list.
 
Plus,
 
I
 
guess
 
the
 
three
 
that
 
are
 
on
 
Melissa's
 
list
 
from
 
this
 
morning
 
that
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
want
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
for
 
spavoidal
 
evaluations
 
for
 
the
 
month
 
of
 
September.
 
 
@44:54

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
great.
 
That's
 
cool.
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
September.
 
Let's
 
go.
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
great.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
keep
 
going
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
course.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
film
 
more
 
ads,
 
do
 
more
 
things,
 
know,
 
just
 
keep
 
optimizing.
 
We
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
part
 
because
 
the
 
ads
 
are
 
working.
 
The
 
cost
 
for
 
booking
 
is
 
low.
 
Only
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
fix
 
is
 
getting
 
people
 
to
 
show
 
up.
 
Once
 
we
 
have
 
that
 
dialed,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
on
 
the
 
wave.
 
Like
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
extremely
 
simple.
 
Like
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
first
 
part.
 
We
 
have
 
the,
 
I
 
actually
 
did
 
a
 
video
 
about
 
that
 
yesterday
 
on
 
the
 
five
 
metrics
 
that
 
are
 
most
 
important
 
as
 
cost
 
for
 
lead.
 
And
 
then
 
we,
 
after
 
that,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
amount
 
of,
 
bookings.
 
then
 
after
 
that,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
no
 
shows
 
versus
 
shows
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
closing
 
and
 
all
 
these,
 
all
 
these
 
things.
 
 
@45:37
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
So
 
actually
 
full
 
transparency,
 
something
 
else
 
that
 
I'm
 
working
 
on
 
is
 
I
 
went
 
with
 
a
 
marketing
 
company
 
to
 
like
 
do
 
SEO
 
optimization
 
and
 
to
 
like
 
manage
 
my
 
online,
 
like
 
I
 
guess
 
status,
 
because
 
one
 
thing
 
people
 
were
 
not
 
pulling
 
up
 
was
 
when
 
they
 
were
 
typing
 
Spravato
 
near
 
me
 
or
 
Spravato
 
treatments
 
or
 
I
 
wasn't
 
showing
 
up.
 
They
 
would
 
only
 
find
 
me
 
through
 
Facebook.
 
So
 
like,
 
even
 
if
 
like,
 
like,
 
They
 
did
 
it
 
through
 
that.
 
They,
 
I
 
guess,
 
didn't
 
think
 
we
 
were
 
a
 
legit
 
company.
 
So
 
I've
 
hired
 
somebody
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
and
 
help
 
optimize
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
It's
 
supposed
 
to
 
have
 
that
 
hopefully
 
fixed
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
month.
 
We'll
 
see.
 
 
@46:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Do
 
they
 
do
 
general
 
SEO,
 
like
 
old
 
school
 
or
 
AI?
 
 
@46:18
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
Because
 
AI
 
is
 
SEO
 
now.
 
Both.
 
They
 
do
 
AI
 
too,
 
yeah.
 
They're
 
going
 
to
 
start
 
posting
 
my
 
blogs
 
online,
 
and
 
then
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
optimize
 
my
 
Facebook
 
profile.
 
And
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
all
 
my
 
posts
 
per
 
month.
 
just
 
straight
 
post,
 
so
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
keep
 
going
 
there
 
and
 
doing
 
AI
 
myself.
 
And
 
it's
 
easy,
 
but
 
it's
 
still
 
time
 
that
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
that
 
I'm
 
up
 
at
 
night
 
trying
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 
 
@46:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
good.
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
 
@46:43
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
And
 
they
 
were
 
compliant.
 
I
 
told
 
them
 
that
 
I
 
was
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
them
 
for
 
the
 
AI
 
or
 
the
 
Facebook
 
and
 
Google
 
ads
 
that
 
I
 
was
 
going
 
to
 
keep
 
using
 
you
 
for
 
right
 
now.
 
And
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
this
 
worked
 
out,
 
and
 
I
 
felt
 
like
 
we
 
had
 
a
 
good
 
thing
 
going.
 
We
 
got
 
traction.
 
We
 
tried
 
to
 
figure
 
out
 
how
 
to
 
optimize
 
it.
 
And
 
they
 
said
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
places,
 
you
 
know,
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
another
 
marketing
 
agency
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
 
@47:01

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
they
 
said
 
they
 
had
 
no
 
problem
 
doing
 
that,
 
so
 
that's
 
cool.
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
mainly
 
all
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
go
 
over.
 
Is
 
there
 
anything
 
else
 
that
 
you
 
guys
 
want
 
to
 
add?
 
Any
 
questions
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that?
 
 
@47:18

Schantz
 
Flores
 
No,
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
it.
 
 
@47:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Cool.
 
Hey
 
girls,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions
 
or
 
anything
 
or?
 
 
@47:27
 
-
 
Schantz
 
Flores
 
We
 
got
 
Melissa.
 
I
 
think
 
Melissa
 
may
 
be
 
getting
 
ready
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
patient.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
We
 
might
 
have
 
lost
 
the
 
girls
 
a
 
second
 
ago.
 
I
 
saw
 
their
 
names
 
drop
 
off.
 
So
 
I'll
 
touch
 
base
 
with
 
them,
 
and
 
I've
 
got
 
this
 
recording.
 
I've
 
got
 
the
 
highlights
 
here.
 
I've
 
got
 
my
 
Fathom
 
recording.
 
 
@47:41

You
 
can
 
send
 
me
 
the
 
video
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
send
 
to
 
them,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
them
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
notes,
 
my
 
AI
 
notes
 
from
 
this,
 
and
 
tell
 
them
 
the
 
things
 
they
 
got
 
to
 
work
 
on.
 
Okay,
 
awesome.
 
Cool.
 
No
 
problem.
 
 
@47:50

Schantz
 
Flores
 
All
 
right.
 
Okay,
 
guys.
 
Thanks,

Have
 
a
 
good
 
one.
 
Talk

Hi
 
there,
 
Rosana.
 
Just
 
a
 
second.
 
Improving
 
your
 
Fireflies
 
and
 
also
 
connecting
 
my
 
AirPods.
 
So,
 
just
 
a
 
second.
 
Speak.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
hear
 
you.
 
 
@0:25

Rosana

Yeah.
 
Can
 
you
 
hear
 
me?
 
 
@0:27

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes.
 
How's
 
it
 
going?
 
Wait,
 
let
 
me
 
turn
 
on
 
my
 
camera.
 
Okay.
 
How's
 
it
 
going?
 
 
@0:33

Rosana

Doing
 
well.
 
Great
 
to
 
meet
 
you.

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Great.
 
Great
 
to
 
meet
 
you,
 
too.
 
So,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
as
 
direct
 
as
 
possible.
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
conversation
 
in
 
which
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
how
 
your
 
dog
 
is
 
doing
 
today.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
one
 
thing,
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
to
 
help
 
you,
 
give
 
you
 
value,
 
show
 
you
 
what
 
I
 
can
 
do,
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
I
 
work,
 
how
 
we
 
work.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
if
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
a
 
good
 
fit,
 
perfect.
 
If
 
not,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
resources
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
help
 
you
 
whether
 
you
 
pay
 
me
 
or
 
not.
 
Pay
 
me.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
 
@1:02
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah,
 
sounds
 
good.
 
 
@1:04
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
marketing
 
audit
 
that
 
you
 
filled
 
out.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
15
 
patients
 
right
 
now.
 
As
 
I
 
see,
 
you
 
have
 
TMS
 
and
 
ketamine.
 
You
 
are
 
working
 
with
 
an
 
agency
 
now
 
and
 
you're
 
getting
 
poor
 
leads.
 
Is
 
that
 
correct?
 
Yes.
 
So
 
first
 
question
 
is,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
happens
 
with
 
the
 
poor
 
leads.
 
What
 
does
 
that
 
mean,
 
poor
 
leads?
 
Can
 
you
 
elaborate
 
on
 
that
 
a
 
little
 
bit?
 
 
@1:34
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Well,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it
 
takes
 
time.
 
They're
 
telling
 
me
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
90
 
days
 
for
 
the
 
ads
 
to
 
get
 
dialed
 
in.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
that
 
I
 
believe
 
that.

@1:45
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
leads
 
that
 
are
 
coming
 
through
 
go
 
cold.
 
We
 
can't
 
get
 
a
 
hold
 
of
 
them.
 
Right
 
now,
 
the
 
call
 
to
 
action
 
is
 
just
 
to
 
fill
 
out
 
a
 
form.
 
So
 
we
 
get
 
their
 
phone
 
number,
 
their
 
email
 
and
 
their
 
diagnoses.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
attempt
 
to.
 
We
 
would
 
them
 
immediately
 
or
 
text
 
them
 
immediately,
 
and
 
we're
 
just
 
not
 
getting
 
any
 
responses.
 
There's
 
also
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
them
 
that
 
are
 
coming
 
outside
 
of
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
consider
 
a
 
radius
 
of
 
where
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
market,
 
over
 
30
 
miles
 
or
 
25
 
miles,
 
enough
 
where
 
they
 
could
 
find
 
a
 
local
 
TMS
 
or
 
Ketamine
 
or
 
Spirbato
 
clinic
 
near
 
them.

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
start
 
analyzing
 
and
 
mapping
 
out
 
exactly
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
the
 
marketing
 
funnel.
 
So
 
first
 
things
 
first,
 
are
 
you
 
guys
 
using
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
or
 
are
 
you
 
using
 
Facebook
 
lead
 
forms?
 
Do
 
have
 
any
 
idea
 
what's
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
these?
 
 
@2:36
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
I
 
believe
 
there's
 
a
 
landing
 
page.

No,
 
let's
 
check
 
that
 
out.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
see,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
something
 
cool.
 
I
 
can
 
search
 
up
 
your
 
clinic
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
you're
 
running
 
right
 
now.

So
 
it's
 
a
 
pretty
 
cool
 
trick
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
and
 
also
 
like
 
analyze
 
competitors.
 
So
 
let's
 
see
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
is
 
that
 
your
 
clinic?
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
So
 
we
 
have,
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
there's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
ads.
 
So
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
you're
 
running
 
with
 
these
 
guys
 
for
 
about
 
a
 
month.
 
So
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
it's
 
been
 
running
 
from
 
the
 
20th
 
of
 
August.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
seems
 
like
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
landing
 
page.
 
You
 
are
 
working
 
with
 
Ketamine
 
Media.
 
Is
 
that
 
correct?
 
 
@3:21
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yes.
 
 
@3:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
template
 
for
 
the
 
landing
 
page,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
nice
 
template.
 
So
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
you're
 
using
 
a
 
landing
 
page
 
is
 
a
 
green
 
flag,
 
okay?
 
Red
 
flag
 
is
 
that
 
they
 
say
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
90
 
days
 
because
 
it
 
doesn't
 
work
 
like
 
that.
 
The
 
messaging
 
is
 
what
 
dictates
 
whether
 
the
 
ads
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
or
 
not.
 
Now,
 
another
 
question
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
is,
 
how
 
many
 
leads
 
are
 
you
 
getting
 
a
 
day?
 
And
 
how
 
long
 
does
 
it
 
take
 
you
 
to
 
call
 
the
 
leads
 
back
 
and
 
get
 
in
 
contact
 
with
 
them?
 
 
@3:53
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So
 
we've
 
literally,
 
we've
 
been
 
up
 
a
 
month.
 
think
 
my
 
ad
 
budget
 
was
 
$2,500
 
and
 
we've
 
gotten
 
a
 
total.
 
Mr.
 
I
 
Maybe
 
13
 
leads.
 
Typically,
 
when
 
they
 
come
 
in,
 
they're
 
getting
 
a
 
call
 
back.
 
We're
 
seeing,
 
unfortunately,
 
an
 
email
 
notification
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
later,
 
so
 
usually
 
within
 
5
 
to
 
10,
 
15
 
minutes,
 
unless
 
it
 
comes
 
in
 
in
 
the
 
evening,
 
and
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
anyone
 
working
 
in
 
the
 
evening
 
to
 
give
 
those
 
leads
 
a
 
call,
 
so
 
they're
 
getting
 
called
 
first
 
thing
 
in
 
the
 
morning.
 
 
@4:20

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
wait,
 
so
 
you
 
spent
 
$2,500
 
both
 
on
 
the
 
agency
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
ads,
 
or
 
just
 
on
 
the
 
ads?
 
 
@4:27
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Just
 
on
 
the
 
ads.
 
so,
 
to
 
me,
 
that's
 
just
 
a
 
really
 
big
 
red
 
flag,
 
and
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
waste
 
any
 
more
 
time.
 
I'll
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
resonated
 
with
 
me
 
from
 
the
 
ad
 
that
 
I
 
saw
 
of
 
yours
 
is
 
I
 
am
 
not
 
a
 
medical
 
provider.
 
I
 
started
 
this
 
clinic
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
impact
 
that
 
it
 
had
 
on
 
close
 
family
 
members'
 
lives,
 
and
 
I
 
find
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
marketing
 
out
 
there
 
is
 
not
 
really
 
geared
 
towards
 
the
 
user.
 
In
 
the
 
feel
 
like
 
there's
 
no
 
emotional
 
hooks.
 
There's
 
no
 
authenticity.
 
dini
 
It's
 
just
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
facts
 
about
 
TMS,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
education
 
is
 
important,
 
but
 
I
 
find
 
this
 
a
 
really
 
whitewashed,
 
kind
 
of
 
boring
 
ad
 
campaign,
 
and
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
mix
 
it
 
up.
 
I've
 
already
 
created
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
content,
 
video
 
content,
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used,
 
but
 
I'm
 
afraid
 
to
 
give
 
it
 
to
 
them
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
if
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
couple
 
it
 
with
 
the
 
right
 
copy
 
to
 
really
 
draw
 
readers
 
in.
 
 
@5:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
first
 
things
 
first
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
with
 
the
 
marketing
 
education,
 
I'm
 
glad
 
that
 
she
 
resonated
 
with
 
the
 
ad,
 
that
 
means
 
I'm
 
doing
 
something
 
right.
 
Another
 
thing
 
is
 
the
 
red
 
flag
 
that
 
you're
 
talking
 
about
 
with
 
the
 
$2,500,
 
that's
 
not
 
a
 
red
 
flag,
 
that's
 
a
 
black
 
flag,
 
that's
 
a
 
major
 
black
 
and
 
red
 
flag,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
call
 
it.
 
That
 
means
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
$220,
 
yeah,
 
$220,
 
that's
 
insane,
 
that's
 
insane,
 
and
 
cold
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
that's
 
very
 
bad.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
clients
 
ads.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
you
 
understand
 
exactly
 
what
 
type
 
of
 
marketing
 
I
 
do.
 
And
 
then
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
time,
 
I
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
two
 
presentations.
 
These
 
are
 
two
 
YouTube
 
videos
 
that
 
I
 
did
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
go
 
watch
 
them,
 
but
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
the
 
presentation
 
to
 
understand
 
exactly
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
and
 
how
 
we
 
work.
 
Before
 
that,
 
which
 
ad
 
did
 
you
 
come
 
from?
 
Did
 
you
 
come
 
from
 
the
 
video
 
ad
 
or
 
from
 
a...
 
 
@6:30
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
meta
 
ad.
 
It
 
was
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
You
 
discussed
 
the...
 
You
 
discussed
 
that
 
most
 
ads
 
are
 
not
 
targeted
 
towards
 
the
 
user's
 
experience,
 
meaning
 
that
 
they're
 
already
 
disillusioned
 
with
 
therapies
 
out
 
there
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
geared
 
towards
 
them
 
because
 
everything
 
has
 
failed.
 
So
 
there's
 
no
 
trust
 
built.
 
 
@7:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
right.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
show
 
you
 
this
 
guy's
 
ad.
 
It's
 
like.
 
Bonus,
 
get,
 
uh-uh-uh.
 
Where
 
is
 
his
 
ad?
 
Just
 
a
 
sec.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
context,
 
um,
 
we
 
have,
 
uh,
 
one
 
campaign
 
running,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
we
 
had
 
this
 
campaign
 
running.
 
The
 
reason
 
it's
 
turned
 
off
 
because
 
Facebook
 
got
 
onto
 
us,
 
caught
 
onto
 
us,
 
because
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
in
 
the
 
landing
 
page
 
is
 
we
 
filter
 
people
 
out,
 
okay,
 
and
 
I
 
usually
 
ask
 
questions
 
about
 
if
 
they're
 
clinically
 
diagnosed.
 
And
 
sometimes
 
Facebook
 
goes.
 
And
 
they
 
understand
 
that,
 
so
 
we
 
needed
 
to
 
duplicate
 
the
 
campaign,
 
but
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
even
 
with
 
this
 
campaign,
 
which
 
surprisingly
 
with
 
more
 
filtering,
 
got
 
a
 
lower
 
cost
 
per
 
lead,
 
we
 
got
 
$11
 
leads
 
and
 
on
 
a
 
way
 
lower
 
budget.
 
And
 
that's
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
ads.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
ad
 
number
 
one
 
that
 
I
 
really,
 
really
 
like
 
to
 
use.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
clinic
 
picture
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that,
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
immensely,
 
immensely
 
well.
 
It's
 
like
 
a
 
breaking
 
news
 
type
 
ad.
 
You
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
it's
 
extremely
 
viral.
 
It's
 
gone
 
extremely
 
viral.
 
And
 
it's
 
basically
 
a
 
very,
 
very
 
long
 
ad
 
that
 
talks
 
about
 
the
 
one
 
real
 
way
 
to
 
solve
 
depression.
 
Obviously,
 
there's
 
not
 
one
 
real
 
way,
 
but
 
the
 
client
 
had
 
no
 
problem
 
using
 
that
 
wording.
 
And
 
it's
 
basically
 
a
 
very,
 
very
 
long
 
ad
 
copy
 
talking
 
about,
 
you
 
know,
 
basically
 
making
 
them
 
feel
 
like
 
we
 
know
 
what
 
they're
 
going
 
through.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we're
 
talking
 
about
 
how
 
old
 
meds
 
work.
 
We
 
educate
 
them.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
what's
 
the
 
alternative.
 
Stop
 
to
 
mute
 
the
 
signal
 
if
 
the
 
house
 
is
 
burning
 
and
 
feed
 
it
 
from
 
the
 
root.
 
then
 
we
 
introduce
 
bravado,
 
explain
 
how
 
it
 
works.
 
And
 
it's
 
basically
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
for
 
ketamine
 
or
 
psychedelic
 
therapy,
 
psilocybin,
 
hopefully
 
psilocybin
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
become
 
legal
 
soon.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
we
 
do.
 
Another
 
type
 
of
 
ad
 
that
 
we
 
run,
 
which
 
works
 
extremely,
 
extremely
 
well,
 
is
 
the
 
patient
 
testimonial
 
ad.
 
Did
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
look
 
up
 
any
 
of
 
my
 
content,
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
or
 
the
 
video
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you?
 
 
@9:23
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
I
 
didn't.
 
I
 
watched
 
the
 
video
 
that
 
you
 
sent,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
found
 
another
 
one
 
just
 
through
 
a
 
Google
 
search,
 
but
 
I
 
haven't
 
gone
 
to
 
your
 
social
 
media
 
page.
 
Is
 
that
 
where
 
you
 
have
 
most
 
of
 
your,
 
yeah?
 
 
@9:33
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes,
 
I
 
have
 
on
 
my
 
Instagram.
 
I
 
have
 
about
 
30
 
videos
 
on
 
my
 
Instagram
 
and
 
another
 
seven
 
videos
 
on
 
YouTube,
 
approximately.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
talk
 
about
 
everything
 
there.
 
So
 
there's,
 
I
 
keep
 
things
 
simple,
 
okay?
 
I
 
use
 
only
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
ads.
 
One
 
is
 
the
 
educational
 
type
 
ad,
 
basically
 
making
 
them
 
understand
 
that
 
we
 
know
 
what
 
they're
 
going
 
through.
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
one
 
is
 
a
 
story
 
type
 
ad,
 
which
 
is
 
basically
 
making
 
people
 
resonate
 
because
 
somebody
 
else
 
has
 
been
 
in
 
their
 
space,
 
in
 
their
 
position,
 
they've
 
been
 
depressed,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
solve.
 
Now,
 
All
 
The
 
problem
 
with
 
ketamine,
 
so
 
we
 
showed
 
them
 
the
 
bridge
 
between
 
point
 
A
 
to
 
point
 
B,
 
which
 
point
 
A
 
is
 
then
 
being
 
depressed,
 
point
 
B
 
is
 
then
 
being
 
happy,
 
the
 
bridge
 
is
 
the
 
ad,
 
and
 
showing
 
them
 
how
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
with
 
Spravato,
 
TMS,
 
ketamine,
 
and
 
psychedelic
 
therapy,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
winning
 
combination
 
to
 
create
 
ads
 
that
 
work,
 
and,
 
but
 
that's
 
the
 
thing,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
it's
 
not
 
only
 
about
 
the
 
ad,
 
it's
 
not
 
only
 
about
 
the
 
ad,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
systematic
 
process,
 
okay,
 
very
 
systematic
 
process
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
calling
 
the
 
leads,
 
making
 
the
 
leads
 
understand,
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
there
 
for
 
them,
 
and
 
also
 
having
 
everything
 
dialed
 
in
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
they
 
feel
 
like
 
it's
 
not
 
an
 
automatic
 
message,
 
okay,
 
so
 
I
 
would
 
usually
 
ask
 
a
 
question,
 
a
 
question
 
that
 
Facebook
 
lets
 
you
 
pass
 
is,
 
what
 
is
 
your
 
insurance,
 
what's
 
your
 
insurance,
 
and
 
then
 
when
 
we
 
ask
 
that
 
question,
 
in
 
the
 
follow-up
 
message,
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
text
 
message
 
that
 
we
 
send
 
them,
 
tell
 
them,
 
hi,
 
this
 
is
 
blah,
 
blah
 
from
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah
 
clinic,
 
we
 
saw
 
that
 
you
 
signed
 
up
 
for
 
XYZ,
 
and
 
that
 
your
 
insurance
 
is
 
Y,
 
is
 
that
 
correct?
 
And
 
we
 
just
 
let
 
them
 
answer.
 
After
 
they
 
answer,
 
there's
 
another
 
automatic
 
message
 
that
 
says,
 
perfect.
 
In
 
order
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
help
 
you,
 
please
 
book
 
your
 
15-minute
 
consultation
 
in
 
the
 
link
 
below
 
so
 
we
 
can
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible.
 
So,
 
you
 
see,
 
we
 
make
 
them
 
interact
 
with
 
us.
 
We
 
also
 
send
 
a
 
personalized
 
message
 
and
 
we
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
take
 
action
 
because
 
now
 
they
 
feel
 
like
 
it's
 
a
 
personalized
 
message.
 
And
 
it's
 
not
 
just
 
an
 
automated
 
tech
 
message
 
like,
 
oh,
 
we
 
got
 
your
 
details.
 
Please
 
do
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah.
 
Okay?
 
Now,
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
is,
 
did
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
sales
 
calls,
 
sales
 
consultations
 
inside
 
the
 
clinic?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
data
 
on
 
that?
 
Because
 
that's
 
also
 
very,
 
very
 
crucial.
 
 
@11:47

Rosana
 
Graves
 
You
 
mean
 
from
 
the
 
13
 
leads
 
that
 
we
 
got?
 
 
@11:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
yeah.
 
Nobody
 
came
 
to
 
the
 
clinic.
 
 
@11:53
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
No,
 
so
 
we're
 
brand
 
new.
 
And
 
of
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
we
 
did
 
get
 
a
 
hold
 
of
 
that
 
we
 
spoke
 
to.
 
Yeah.
 
A
 
few
 
of
 
them
 
were
 
just
 
outside
 
of
 
the
 
radius,
 
so
 
we
 
ended
 
up
 
recommending
 
them
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
different
 
clinics,
 
and
 
then
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
couple,
 
we
 
didn't
 
take
 
their
 
insurance,
 
so
 
we
 
couldn't
 
serve
 
them.
 
 
@12:17

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
I
 
understand.
 
And
 
in
 
general,
 
do
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
any
 
other
 
source
 
of
 
leads
 
besides
 
the
 
ads,
 
or
 
is
 
it
 
the
 
only
 
one?
 
 
@12:26
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
No,
 
not
 
right
 
now.
 
We're
 
working
 
on
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
referral
 
partner
 
strategy,
 
so
 
that's
 
currently
 
being
 
executed,
 
but
 
beyond
 
the
 
ads,
 
no,
 
I'm,
 
unfortunately,
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
psychiatrist,
 
right,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
my
 
own
 
patient
 
base
 
where
 
I'm
 
building
 
a
 
Spravato
 
or
 
Ketamine
 
or
 
TMS
 
clinic
 
off
 
of
 
that
 
patient
 
base.
 
So
 
it's
 
important
 
that
 
my
 
ads
 
and
 
my
 
marketing
 
campaign
 
work
 
effectively.
 
I'm
 
in
 
an
 
area
 
of
 
about
 
100,000
 
people.
 
I
 
have
 
zero
 
competition
 
in
 
this
 
area.
 
There's
 
no
 
other
 
Ketamine,
 
Spravato
 
or
 
TMS
 
clinic,
 
so
 
there's
 
no…
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
shouldn't
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
draw
 
from
 
the
 
community,
 
and
 
a
 
very
 
high
 
net
 
worth
 
community,
 
yeah.
 
 
@13:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
correct.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
two
 
green
 
flags,
 
three
 
green
 
flags
 
actually,
 
high
 
net
 
worth,
 
no
 
competitors,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
white
 
space.
 
And
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
dialed
 
in,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion,
 
is
 
the
 
content,
 
okay,
 
the
 
content
 
of
 
the
 
ads.
 
And
 
what
 
I
 
do
 
is
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
ad
 
that
 
I
 
showed
 
you,
 
okay,
 
but
 
we
 
also
 
use
 
another
 
ad,
 
which
 
is
 
an
 
ad
 
that
 
I
 
encourage
 
everybody
 
to
 
do,
 
okay,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
video
 
ad.
 
And
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
ad
 
that
 
works
 
the
 
best.
 
This
 
ad
 
I
 
didn't
 
turn
 
off
 
because
 
it
 
brought
 
a
 
good
 
lead.
 
Once
 
it
 
gets
 
to
 
$100,
 
then
 
we
 
close
 
the
 
ad
 
itself.
 
So
 
there's
 
like
 
a
 
process
 
to
 
everything.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
other
 
company
 
is
 
doing,
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
any
 
processes.
 
But
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
it's
 
a
 
video
 
ad,
 
and
 
we
 
basically
 
have
 
two
 
hooks
 
here,
 
and
 
we
 
just
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
problem.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
say,
 
so
 
let's
 
look
 
at
 
this
 
hook.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
exactly
 
what
 
a
 
hook
 
is.

Do
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
a
 
hook
 
is?
 
There's
 
a
 
new
 
depression
 
treatment
 
that's
 
seeing
 
a
 
92%
 
response
 
rate
 
in
 
patients
 
within
 
the
 
first
 
three
 
weeks.
 
SCREEN
 
SHARING:
 
Oriel
 
started
 
screen

-
 
WATCH
 
It's
 
FDA-proof,
 
it's
 
not
 
based
 
on
 
pills,
 
and
 
it's
 
backed
 
by
 
clinics
 
like
 
Harvard
 
and
 
Yale.
 
If
 
you've
 
been
 
struggling,
 
this
 
may
 
be
 
the
 
solution
 
for
 
you.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
hook
 
number
 
one.
 
You
 
see,
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
long
 
ad.
 
It's
 
a
 
very
 
long
 
ad.
 
And
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
tell
 
you,
 
oh,
 
don't
 
use
 
long
 
ads,
 
people
 
don't
 
watch
 
them,
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah.
 
This
 
is,
 
sorry
 
for
 
the
 
word,
 
that's
 
.
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
when
 
a
 
patient,
 
a
 
client,
 
patient,
 
consumer,
 
no
 
matter
 
who,
 
when
 
they
 
resonate
 
with
 
the
 
ad,
 
and
 
it
 
talks
 
to
 
them,
 
and
 
the
 
flow
 
of
 
the
 
ad
 
is
 
structured
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that's
 
making
 
them
 
want
 
to
 
keep
 
watching,
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
watch
 
the
 
ad,
 
no
 
matter
 
what.
 
It's
 
basic
 
psychology,
 
okay?
 
 
@14:57
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So
 
what
 
we
 
like
 
to
 
do,
 
is
 
we
 
like
 
to
 
come
 
from...
 
 
@15:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
A
 
couple
 
of
 
different
 
angles,
 
specifically
 
with
 
this
 
clinic,
 
because
 
their
 
budget
 
is
 
not
 
very
 
high,
 
we
 
only
 
have
 
two
 
hooks
 
here,
 
we
 
have
 
another
 
seven
 
hooks
 
to
 
test,
 
and
 
we're
 
just
 
seeing
 
what
 
works.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
there's
 
an
 
ad
 
that
 
caught
 
on,
 
and
 
it
 
works
 
well,
 
and
 
it's
 
just
 
bringing
 
in
 
leads.
 
So
 
once
 
you
 
crack
 
an
 
ad,
 
it's
 
very,
 
very
 
simple
 
to
 
scale
 
it,
 
because
 
the
 
messaging,
 
once
 
it
 
works
 
and
 
you
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on,
 
you
 
can
 
just
 
do
 
it
 
again
 
and
 
again
 
and
 
again.
 
And
 
once
 
you
 
get
 
more
 
patients
 
in,
 
then
 
there's
 
starts
 
like
 
a
 
snowball
 
effect,
 
if
 
you
 
get
 
people
 
to
 
actually,
 
you
 
know,
 
leave
 
testimonials,
 
which
 
is
 
extremely
 
crucial,
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
people
 
having
 
video
 
testimonials,
 
after
 
you
 
field
 
them
 
and
 
help
 
them,
 
you
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
how
 
crucial
 
it
 
is
 
to
 
take
 
testimonials
 
and
 
create
 
ads
 
based
 
on
 
these
 
testimonials.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
that's
 
based
 
on
 
that.
 
Now,
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
if
 
I'm
 
overwhelming
 
you
 
with
 
information,
 
or
 
if
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
let
 
me
 
know,
 
because
 
my
 
purpose
 
here
 
is
 
to
 
just
 
show
 
you
 
exactly
 
how
 
I
 
work,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
sell
 
you
 
dreams,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
do
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
it's
 
not
 
me.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
feel
 
free
 
to
 
ask
 
me.
 
 
@16:03
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
anything?
 
Yeah,
 
just
 
a
 
real
 
quick
 
question.
 
So
 
on
 
your
 
landing
 
page,
 
you're
 
just
 
getting
 
them
 
to
 
fill
 
out
 
those
 
questions,
 
right?
 
Because
 
you
 
do
 
landing
 
pages,
 
correct?
 
 
@16:15
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
100%.
 
 
@16:17
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
And
 
that's
 
prompting
 
a
 
text,
 
and
 
then
 
it's
 
at
 
that
 
point
 
that
 
you're
 
sending
 
them
 
a
 
booking
 
link
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
call?
 
 
@16:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
we
 
give
 
them
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
call
 
in
 
the
 
thank
 
you
 
page.
 
And
 
also,
 
we
 
wait
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
first
 
message.
 
And
 
after
 
they
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
first
 
message
 
and
 
create
 
an
 
interaction
 
with
 
them,
 
then
 
we
 
also
 
send
 
them
 
the
 
booking
 
link
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@16:36
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Okay.
 
And
 
do
 
you
 
find
 
that
 
people
 
are,
 
because
 
my
 
marketing
 
agency
 
said
 
that
 
typically
 
people
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
call?
 
 
@16:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
How's
 
that
 
working
 
for
 
your
 
clients?
 
No,
 
that
 
people
 
are
 
booking
 
a
 
call.
 
They
 
are
 
booking
 
a
 
call
 
because
 
they
 
feel
 
like
 
they're
 
getting
 
the
 
personalized
 
message.
 
And
 
also,
 
they're
 
getting
 
warmed
 
up
 
before
 
they
 
even
 
leave
 
their
 
details.
 
So
 
they
 
don't
 
just
 
see
 
a
 
ad,
 
say,
 
oh,
 
this
 
is
 
me.
 
Maybe
 
for
 
me,
 
they
 
sign
 
up,
 
they
 
forget
 
about
 
it
 
after
 
two
 
minutes,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
just
 
forget
 
about
 
it.
 
No,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
to
 
touch
 
their
 
emotional
 
points
 
to
 
the
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
feel
 
like
 
they
 
need
 
this.
 
And
 
once
 
they
 
feel
 
invested
 
in
 
it,
 
if
 
they
 
watch
 
a
 
three-minute
 
video
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
sign
 
up,
 
there's
 
a
 
way
 
higher
 
chance
 
of
 
them
 
actually
 
interacting
 
with
 
you
 
and
 
taking
 
action
 
on
 
what
 
you
 
tell
 
them
 
to
 
do
 
because
 
they
 
understand
 
you
 
better.
 
They
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
doing.
 
They
 
know
 
you
 
as
 
a
 
person.
 
But
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
random
 
ad,
 
whether
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
static
 
image
 
of
 
a
 
person
 
being
 
happy
 
after
 
they
 
solve
 
depression
 
or
 
just
 
a
 
picture
 
of
 
ketamine,
 
of
 
a
 
ketamine
 
treatment
 
or
 
TMS
 
machine,
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
same
 
job
 
done
 
because
 
it
 
doesn't
 
touch
 
your
 
emotional
 
pain
 
points.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
but
 
also
 
a
 
very
 
crucial
 
point,
 
and
 
that's
 
the
 
thing
 
I'm
 
working
 
on
 
right
 
now,
 
is
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
call
 
leads
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible,
 
which
 
is
 
also
 
extremely
 
important,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
send
 
them
 
a
 
message,
 
we
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
call
 
them
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible.
 
I'm
 
actually
 
implementing
 
a
 
voice
 
AI
 
thing
 
right
 
now.
 
Now,
 
it's
 
very...
 
And
 
it's
 
getting
 
to
 
the
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
it
 
sounds
 
very
 
human.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
front
 
this
 
team,
 
that's
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do.
 
Because
 
the
 
speed
 
to
 
lead
 
is
 
extremely
 
important.
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
watched
 
one
 
of
 
my
 
other
 
videos.
 
If
 
you
 
call
 
leads
 
after
 
5-10
 
minutes,
 
their
 
chances
 
of
 
converting
 
drop
 
by
 
400%.
 
It's
 
been
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
Harvard
 
Business
 
Study
 
that
 
it's
 
been
 
done
 
on
 
over
 
15,000
 
leads.
 
So
 
extremely
 
crucial.
 
It's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
pieces
 
of
 
the
 
puzzle
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
pieced
 
in
 
together.
 
Once
 
you
 
piece
 
everything
 
together,
 
it
 
just
 
works.
 
It's
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
ads.
 
It's
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
landing
 
page.
 
It's
 
not
 
just
 
sending
 
a
 
message.
 
It's
 
everything
 
together.
 
But
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
bottleneck
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
funnel,
 
which
 
is
 
supposed
 
to
 
be,
 
honestly,
 
the
 
easiest
 
part.
 
It's
 
supposed
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
easiest
 
part.
 
So
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
you're
 
getting
 
$230
 
leads,
 
it's
 
just
 
not
 
okay.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
this
 
is
 
basically
 
it.

Okay.
 
So
 
Ketamine
 
Media
 
is
 
probably
 
using...
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
into
 
the
 
technical,
 
explain
 
exactly
 
how
 
dynamic
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
and
 
everything.
 
So
 
Ketamine
 
Media
 
is
 
probably
 
using
 
this
 
platform,
 
which
 
is
 
called
 
Go
 
High
 
Level,
 
okay?
 
And
 
Go
 
High
 
Level
 
is
 
a
 
platform
 
in
 
which
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
to
 
manage
 
all
 
the
 
leads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
okay?
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
this
 
platform
 
to,
 
again,
 
use
 
everything
 
with
 
the
 
leads,
 
contacting
 
the
 
leads.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
have...
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
phone
 
app
 
of
 
Go
 
High
 
Level,
 
of
 
Lead
 
Connector,
 
or...?
 
 
@19:44

Rosana
 
Graves
 
I
 
don't.
 
I
 
don't.
 
That
 
is
 
what
 
they're
 
using.
 
I've
 
used
 
Go
 
High
 
Level
 
with
 
other
 
businesses
 
that
 
I've
 
worked
 
with,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
app,
 
actually.
 
 
@19:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
The
 
app
 
is
 
extremely
 
important
 
because
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
notifications
 
there
 
and
 
call
 
the
 
leads
 
from
 
there.
 
 
@19:58
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Like,
 
that's...
 
Yeah,
 
I'll
 
download
 
that
 
now.
 
 
@21:00

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
As
 
soon
 
as
 
possible.
 
the
 
foundations
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
set.
 
Meanwhile,
 
in
 
the
 
meanwhile,
 
when
 
we
 
set
 
the
 
foundations,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
video
 
ad
 
scripts.
 
Okay.
 
You
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
film
 
the
 
scripts.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
you'll
 
be
 
good
 
with
 
filming
 
scripts
 
because
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
you
 
have
 
charisma.
 
Okay.
 
It
 
seems
 
like
 
you
 
have
 
charisma
 
and
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
good
 
on
 
video.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
that's
 
a
 
very
 
green
 
flag
 
for
 
me.
 
So
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
film
 
the
 
scripts.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
instructions
 
exactly
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
And
 
after
 
you
 
film
 
the
 
ads,
 
you
 
send
 
them
 
to
 
me,
 
we
 
edit
 
them.
 
We
 
take
 
access
 
to
 
all
 
the
 
Facebook
 
thingies
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
making
 
sure
 
that
 
everything
 
works.
 
And
 
our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
go
 
live
 
within
 
seven
 
business
 
days.
 
Okay.
 
Usually
 
it
 
happens
 
even
 
before,
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
our
 
goal.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
Also,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
having
 
calls
 
every
 
two
 
weeks
 
to
 
analyze
 
performance,
 
understand
 
where
 
our
 
bottlenecks
 
are,
 
see
 
what
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
improve.
 
Is
 
it
 
with
 
the
 
lead
 
quality?
 
Okay.
 
Is
 
it
 
with
 
the
 
show
 
up
 
rate?
 
Is
 
it
 
with
 
people,
 
not
 
booking
 
calls
 
and
 
see,
 
okay,
 
this
 
is
 
our
 
bottleneck.
 
What
 
can
 
So
 
problem,
 
solution,
 
problem,
 
solution.
 
It's
 
a
 
never-ending
 
cycle
 
until
 
we
 
optimize
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
you're
 
happy.
 
Because
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
optimize
 
for
 
is
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
a
 
CPA,
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition
 
of
 
a
 
client.
 
How
 
much
 
is
 
it
 
going
 
to
 
cost
 
us
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
patient
 
in
 
the
 
chair?
 
We
 
don't
 
care
 
about
 
anything
 
else.
 
That's
 
what
 
we
 
optimize
 
for
 
and
 
we
 
basically
 
reverse
 
engineer
 
what
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
that
 
point.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
 
@22:28
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
I
 
agree.
 
 
@22:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
just
 
continuously
 
improve.
 
Every
 
time
 
that
 
our
 
ads
 
get
 
fatigued,
 
we
 
create
 
new
 
ads.
 
How
 
do
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
ads
 
get
 
fatigued?
 
It's
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
frequency
 
in
 
the
 
ads
 
manager.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
just
 
basically
 
see,
 
okay,
 
what's
 
going
 
on?
 
This
 
ad
 
has
 
died
 
out.
 
Let's
 
see
 
what
 
worked.
 
Reiterate.
 
Do
 
more
 
of
 
that.
 
Try
 
new
 
ads.
 
Testimonials.
 
We're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
go,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
flowing
 
all
 
the
 
time.
 
Okay,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
Ketamine
 
Media
 
does.
 
I've
 
just,
 
I
 
talked
 
with
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
worked
 
with
 
them.
 
They
 
were
 
They're
 
extremely
 
disappointed.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
strong
 
marketing
 
presence,
 
I
 
guess,
 
but
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
most
 
of
 
our
 
clients
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
me,
 
so
 
I
 
don't
 
really
 
care
 
about
 
that.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
 
@23:15
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
you've
 
worked
 
with
 
other
 
people
 
that
 
were
 
disappointed
 
with
 
Ketamine
 
Media
 
specifically?
 
 
@23:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
yeah.
 
So,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
there's
 
people
 
that
 
come
 
on
 
the
 
call
 
with
 
me
 
and
 
sometimes
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
that
 
type
 
of
 
person
 
that
 
likes
 
to
 
sell
 
dreams
 
and
 
like
 
touch
 
the
 
pain
 
points
 
and
 
I
 
just
 
show
 
what
 
I
 
do,
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
I
 
overwhelm
 
people
 
sometimes
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
just
 
feel
 
like
 
they
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
anything.
 
So,
 
I've
 
actually
 
lost
 
sales
 
because
 
of
 
that,
 
but
 
it's
 
completely
 
fine.
 
mean,
 
the
 
main
 
problem
 
is
 
that
 
these
 
marketing
 
agencies
 
instill
 
limiting
 
beliefs
 
inside
 
clinic
 
owners,
 
which
 
makes
 
them
 
freeze
 
and
 
not
 
do
 
marketing
 
at
 
all
 
because
 
they
 
think
 
that
 
marketing
 
doesn't
 
work.
 
If
 
this
 
huge
 
ketamine
 
marketing
 
thing
 
that
 
has
 
so
 
many
 
clients
 
did
 
not
 
work
 
for
 
me,
 
nobody's
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
for
 
me.
 
And
 
it's
 
just
 
sad
 
that
 
I
 
instilled
 
these
 
limiting
 
beliefs
 
because
 
they
 
have
 
tools
 
to
 
help
 
people
 
and
 
just
 
try
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
fix
 
that.
 
And
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
actually
 
uploading
 
content
 
and
 
doing
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
to
 
actually
 
give
 
value
 
before
 
I
 
even
 
ask
 
for
 
anything
 
back.
 
 
@24:25
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
rant
 
here.
 
Yeah,
 
well,
 
no,
 
no,
 
that's
 
okay.
 
I
 
worked
 
for
 
online
 
coaches
 
and
 
consultants
 
in
 
that
 
industry
 
for
 
a
 
long
 
time
 
before
 
I
 
started
 
this
 
business.
 
And
 
I
 
do
 
understand
 
that
 
there's
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
an
 
art
 
to
 
this
 
and
 
that
 
it's
 
constantly
 
changing,
 
right?
 
As
 
far
 
as,
 
you
 
know,
 
it
 
looks,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
recommend
 
as
 
an
 
ad
 
budget
 
considering
 
my
 
circumstance?
 
So
 
Exactly.
 
in
 
 
@25:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
it
 
is
 
actually
 
decided
 
not
 
day
 
by
 
day,
 
but
 
by
 
a
 
period
 
of
 
time.
 
So
 
within
 
two
 
weeks,
 
I
 
recommend
 
starting
 
with
 
a
 
$35
 
to
 
$40
 
a
 
day
 
budget
 
to
 
get
 
an
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
two
 
weeks
 
of
 
what's
 
actually
 
happening.
 
Okay,
 
what
 
you
 
shouldn't
 
do
 
is
 
run
 
for
 
a
 
month,
 
spend
 
$2,500,
 
get
 
13
 
leads
 
and
 
say
 
it
 
takes
 
90
 
days.
 
Obviously,
 
not.
 
It's
 
not
 
the
 
case,
 
because
 
there's
 
obviously
 
something
 
wrong.
 
Because
 
if
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
numbers
 
themselves,
 
okay,
 
if
 
you
 
sell
 
a
 
treatment,
 
a
 
TMS
 
treatment,
 
okay,
 
package
 
for
 
how
 
much
 
do
 
you
 
sell?
 
Usually
 
a
 
TMS
 
package?
 
 
@25:52
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
What's
 
your
 
pricing?
 
$9,000.
 
 
@25:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
$9,000.
 
 
@25:54
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
$9,000.,000.
 
If
 
they're
 
not
 
covered.
 
 
@25:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
if
 
you're
 
selling
 
a
 
package
 
for
 
$9,000,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
from
 
these
 
$9
 
Okay.
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
maximum
 
amount
 
that
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
to
 
acquire
 
a
 
patient?
 
Okay.
 
Is
 
it
 
$2,000?
 
Is
 
it
 
$1,500?
 
Is
 
it
 
$3,000?
 
And
 
you
 
understand
 
this
 
number
 
based
 
on
 
your
 
clinic's
 
numbers,
 
based
 
on
 
what
 
your
 
expenses
 
are,
 
based
 
on
 
what
 
my
 
expenses
 
are.
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
exactly.
 
Okay.
 
This
 
is
 
the,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
highest
 
number
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
patient.
 
And
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
optimize
 
that
 
to
 
be
 
as
 
low
 
as
 
possible.
 
But
 
when
 
you
 
run
 
for
 
a
 
whole
 
month,
 
you
 
spend
 
$2,500
 
and
 
not
 
even
 
single
 
patient
 
came
 
in
 
through
 
the
 
door.
 
That
 
means
 
that
 
you're
 
already
 
in
 
a,
 
in
 
a
 
position
 
in
 
which
 
your
 
ROI
 
is,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
one
 
to
 
three
 
at
 
max.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
like,
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
very,
 
very
 
good,
 
but
 
nobody
 
even
 
came
 
through
 
the
 
door
 
because
 
what
 
usually
 
happens
 
is
 
that
 
people
 
sign
 
up.
 
And
 
then
 
there's,
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
a
 
good
 
job,
 
50%
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
sign
 
up
 
for
 
a
 
consult
 
and
 
then
 
50%,
 
50
 
to
 
60
 
to
 
70,
 
between
 
50%
 
of
 
these
 
people
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
inside
 
the
 
clinic.
 
And
 
then
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
a
 
good
 
job.
 
Up
 
at
 
the
 
clinic,
 
50%
 
of
 
these
 
people
 
are
 
actually
 
going
 
to
 
sign
 
up.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
numbers
 
game
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
and
 
reverse
 
engineer
 
to
 
understand,
 
okay,
 
what
 
are
 
we
 
working
 
here
 
with?
 
What
 
is
 
our
 
KPI?
 
Not
 
just
 
go
 
blindly
 
say
 
it
 
takes
 
90
 
days.
 
No,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
take
 
90
 
days,
 
especially
 
in
 
a
 
local
 
area,
 
okay?
 
Especially
 
in
 
a
 
local
 
area.
 
I
 
agree.
 
 
@27:23
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
No,
 
I
 
do
 
agree
 
with
 
you.
 
Now,
 
are
 
you
 
open
 
to,
 
it
 
sounds
 
like
 
you
 
have
 
some
 
prescribed
 
scripts
 
that
 
you
 
like
 
for
 
video,
 
you
 
know,
 
for
 
video
 
material,
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
some
 
particular
 
ads
 
that
 
you
 
know
 
are
 
working
 
well
 
for
 
other
 
people.
 
How
 
inventive
 
are
 
you
 
getting
 
with
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
creative
 
or
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
strategy?
 
Because
 
I,
 
I,
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
following
 
what's
 
working
 
for
 
other
 
individuals,
 
because
 
if
 
it's
 
proven
 
by
 
data,
 
then
 
of
 
course
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 
But
 
if
 
that
 
doesn't
 
work
 
with
 
my
 
locale,
 
like
 
if
 
it's.
 
It's
 
not
 
hitting
 
the
 
audience
 
here
 
in
 
Castle
 
Rock.
 
How
 
willing
 
are
 
you
 
to
 
be
 
flexible
 
and
 
maybe
 
collaborate
 
on
 
different
 
strategies
 
for
 
ad
 
copy
 
or
 
ad
 
content
 
and
 
material?
 
 
@28:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Of
 
course.
 
So
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
copy,
 
what
 
I
 
like
 
about
 
copy,
 
if
 
something
 
doesn't
 
work,
 
which
 
it
 
usually
 
does,
 
obviously.
 
And
 
after
 
such
 
a
 
long
 
time,
 
I've
 
developed
 
sort
 
of
 
a
 
sixth
 
sense
 
to
 
that.
 
We
 
try
 
different
 
things
 
because,
 
again,
 
as
 
I've
 
said,
 
we
 
have
 
one
 
goal.
 
OK,
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
to
 
optimize
 
for
 
the
 
lowest
 
cost
 
per
 
acquisition.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
everything
 
possible
 
and
 
test
 
everything
 
possible
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
that
 
point.
 
So
 
if
 
there's
 
things
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
based
 
on
 
my
 
experience
 
and
 
they're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
work,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
call
 
and
 
understand,
 
OK,
 
is
 
there
 
a
 
specific
 
pattern
 
that
 
you
 
see
 
with
 
patients?
 
Is
 
there
 
anything
 
that
 
they're
 
telling
 
you?
 
Is
 
there
 
something
 
different
 
about
 
the
 
mentality
 
of
 
people
 
in
 
your
 
area
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
should
 
focus
 
on?
 
But
 
usually
 
we
 
don't
 
even
 
get
 
to
 
these
 
points.
 
We
 
don't
 
get
 
to
 
these
 
points
 
because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
marketing
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
work
 
with
 
online
 
coaches
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
You
 
know,
 
marketing
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
psychology.
 
Once
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
psychology
 
right,
 
then
 
everything
 
else
 
is
 
way
 
simpler.
 
And
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
being
 
inventive,
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
like
 
to
 
reinvent
 
the
 
wheel.
 
I
 
just
 
like
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
psychology
 
and
 
just
 
use
 
different
 
ad
 
angles.
 
So
 
I
 
am,
 
like,
 
using
 
ads
 
as
 
a
 
puzzle.
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
hook.
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
meat
 
of
 
the
 
ad,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
concept
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
on.
 
So
 
if
 
it's
 
educated,
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
testimonial
 
or
 
a
 
story
 
ad.
 
And
 
then
 
after
 
that,
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
call
 
to
 
action.
 
And
 
that's
 
it.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
testimonials,
 
also
 
inject
 
testimonials
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
ad
 
to
 
boost
 
the
 
proof
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
make
 
people
 
feel
 
like
 
it's
 
even
 
better.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
I
 
actually
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
an
 
ad
 
of
 
this
 
company
 
called
 
Greenbrook.
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
Greenbrook
 
TMS?
 
 
@29:50
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Have
 
you
 
heard
 
of
 
them?
 
 
@29:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
They're
 
probably
 
the
 
biggest
 
provider
 
of
 
TMS
 
in
 
the
 
whole
 
of
 
the
 
U.S.
 
And
 
for
 
them,
 
I'm
 
consulting
 
to
 
them.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
one
 
ad
 
that
 
is
 
a
 
story-based
 
ad.
 
So
 
it
 
starts
 
with
 
the
 
video
 
of
 
the
 
client
 
saying,
 
by
 
the
 
grace
 
of
 
God,
 
I'm
 
still
 
here.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
very
 
dark
 
period
 
for
 
me
 
and
 
I
 
almost
 
took
 
my
 
own
 
life.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
cut
 
off
 
to
 
the
 
UGC
 
creator
 
or
 
the
 
client
 
saying,
 
Kimberly
 
was
 
dealing
 
with
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression
 
and
 
almost
 
gave
 
up.
 
If
 
you're
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
spot,
 
this
 
is
 
for
 
you.
 
You
 
know,
 
to
 
catch
 
the
 
audience.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
catch
 
the
 
audience
 
and
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
keep
 
watching.
 
Then
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
Kimberly's
 
story.
 
We
 
talk
 
about
 
her
 
depression
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
also
 
talk
 
about
 
what
 
she
 
did
 
to
 
get
 
people
 
to
 
resonate
 
with
 
her.
 
Medication,
 
adjustments
 
waiting,
 
and
 
the
 
depression
 
still
 
lingered.
 
Honestly,
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
surprise
 
because
 
here's
 
the
 
truth.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
explain
 
to
 
them
 
based
 
on
 
stats
 
and
 
scientific
 
data
 
on
 
why
 
it
 
doesn't
 
work
 
for
 
them,
 
why
 
they're
 
not
 
broken.
 
Because
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
don't
 
know
 
this
 
trial
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
done,
 
which
 
is
 
actually
 
insane.
 
The
 
amount
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
don't
 
recover
 
from
 
using
 
antidepressants,
 
and
 
we
 
just
 
educate
 
them
 
and
 
we
 
give
 
them
 
clarity.
 
That's
 
like
 
a
 
blown
 
away
 
moment.
 
Okay?
 
And
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
talk
 
cycling
 
through
 
pills,
 
living
 
half-lives,
 
and
 
not
 
to
 
mention
 
the
 
horrible
 
side
 
effects,
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
anchoring
 
the
 
pain,
 
just
 
agitating
 
the
 
pain.
 
Then
 
we're
 
talking
 
about
 
coming
 
back
 
to
 
Kimberly,
 
and
 
because
 
of
 
that
 
simple
 
system
 
she
 
always
 
took
 
in
 
her
 
own
 
life,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
transfer
 
to
 
the
 
solution,
 
and
 
we
 
talk
 
We
 
about
 
TMS,
 
and
 
we
 
explain
 
about
 
what
 
TMS
 
is.
 
Okay?
 
It's
 
not
 
on
 
pill,
 
not
 
therapy.
 
We
 
explain
 
exactly
 
how
 
it
 
works,
 
what
 
it
 
does,
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
works
 
on
 
the
 
brain.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
say,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
happened
 
to
 
Kimberly.
 
10-second
 
punchline
 
of
 
her
 
talking
 
about
 
her
 
result.
 
She's
 
happy
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
boost
 
the
 
proof
 
again.
 
It's
 
not
 
just
 
for
 
Kimberly.
 
Here's
 
what
 
other
 
people
 
have
 
to
 
say
 
as
 
well.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
testimonials
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
we
 
then
 
close
 
the
 
ad,
 
give
 
them
 
a
 
call
 
to
 
action,
 
and
 
that's
 
it.
 
This
 
ad
 
is
 
in
 
production.
 
I
 
already
 
know
 
that
 
this
 
ad
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
insanely
 
well.
 
I
 
just
 
know
 
it.
 
Because
 
after
 
doing
 
so
 
many
 
of
 
these
 
ads,
 
I
 
am
 
just,
 
again,
 
it's
 
a
 
sixth
 
sense.
 
 
@32:12
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
It's
 
just
 
psychology.
 
 
@32:13
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
ideally,
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
ads
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
create.
 
Okay.
 
These
 
are
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
because
 
once
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
bank
 
of
 
10
 
testimonials,
 
10
 
stories
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
talk
 
about,
 
you
 
can
 
just
 
blow
 
everything
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
water
 
with
 
your
 
marketing.
 
Because
 
it's
 
the
 
simplest
 
form
 
of
 
content,
 
but
 
it's
 
also
 
the
 
one
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
most
 
for
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
people
 
because
 
what
 
they
 
need
 
is
 
belief.
 
They
 
don't,
 
we're
 
not
 
selling
 
them
 
a
 
facial
 
treatment
 
or
 
a
 
roofing
 
or
 
to
 
fix
 
the
 
roof.
 
We're
 
selling
 
them
 
hope.
 
Hope.
 
That's
 
what
 
they
 
care
 
about.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
so
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
do.
 
 
@32:52

Rosana
 
Graves
 
How
 
long
 
have
 
you
 
been
 
working?
 
How
 
long
 
have
 
you
 
been
 
working
 
in
 
this
 
industry?
 
If
 
you
 
don't
 
mind
 
me
 
asking.
 
 
@32:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
okay
 
if
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
long
 
time.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
It's
 
about
 
four
 
months.
 
I've
 
gotten
 
into
 
this
 
in
 
about
 
four
 
months.
 
In
 
general,
 
I've
 
been
 
in
 
marketing
 
for
 
the
 
past
 
four
 
years.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you've
 
read
 
my
 
bio
 
and
 
everything.
 
I
 
work
 
with
 
over
 
150
 
clients,
 
manage
 
over
 
$1
 
million
 
in
 
ad
 
spend.
 
And
 
the
 
reason
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
how
 
the
 
psychology
 
of
 
marketing
 
is
 
because
 
I'm
 
from
 
Israel,
 
if
 
you
 
saw
 
from
 
the
 
ad
 
library.
 
So
 
the
 
reason
 
is
 
because
 
in
 
Israel,
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
get
 
to
 
choose
 
and
 
pick
 
a
 
specific
 
industry
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
work
 
with.
 
So
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
crack
 
every
 
client's
 
industry
 
from
 
zero.
 
And
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
marketing
 
at
 
its
 
core.
 
And
 
that
 
allowed
 
me
 
to
 
develop
 
skills
 
in
 
which
 
it's
 
way
 
easier
 
for
 
me
 
now
 
to
 
burst
 
into
 
this
 
industry
 
and
 
say
 
like,
 
okay,
 
I
 
know
 
exactly
 
what
 
to
 
do.
 
I
 
have
 
these
 
skills
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
experience
 
for
 
that.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
about
 
four
 
months,
 
I
 
really
 
do
 
plan
 
to
 
take
 
over
 
this
 
industry
 
in
 
this
 
next
 
12
 
months.
 
That's
 
my
 
goal.
 
That's
 
Um,
 
and
 
yeah,
 
just,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
world
 
in
 
1%
 
and
 
also,
 
you
 
know,
 
achieve
 
financial
 
freedom
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
all
 
the
 
good
 
stuff.
 
 
@34:11
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
do
 
you,
 
so
 
you
 
must
 
be
 
a
 
small
 
team
 
now,
 
right?
 
Um,
 
which
 
means
 
I
 
get,
 
every
 
two
 
week
 
meeting
 
would
 
be
 
with
 
you
 
or
 
a
 
team
 
member.
 
 
@34:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
with
 
me
 
at
 
some
 
point.
 
would
 
transition
 
to
 
a
 
team
 
member,
 
a
 
client
 
success
 
manager,
 
which
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
working
 
with,
 
um,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
happen
 
at
 
once
 
because
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
there
 
on
 
the
 
calls
 
and
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
um,
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
practicing.
 
And
 
also
 
what's
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
thing
 
for
 
me
 
is
 
that
 
once
 
I
 
onboard
 
somebody,
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
values
 
that
 
I'm
 
looking
 
for,
 
because
 
for
 
me,
 
it's
 
values,
 
skills,
 
and
 
then
 
experience.
 
Once
 
people
 
have
 
the
 
values
 
that
 
I'm
 
looking
 
towards
 
and
 
they
 
understand
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
what
 
we're
 
doing,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
way
 
easier
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
onboard
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
team.
 
And
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like,
 
like,
 
it's
 
easy
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
you.
 
Okay.
 
It's
 
easy
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
you
 
because
 
I
 
know
 
I'm
 
not
 
talking
 
from
 
a
 
point
 
of,
 
I'm,
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
desperate.
 
To
 
sell
 
you
 
something,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
actually
 
help
 
you.
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
I've
 
done,
 
and
 
I
 
know
 
I
 
have
 
value
 
to
 
give.
 
And
 
I
 
want
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
work
 
with
 
you
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
So
 
you're
 
never
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
left
 
alone.
 
That's
 
important
 
to
 
know.
 
 
@35:16
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So
 
far,
 
what
 
are
 
you
 
seeing
 
as
 
the
 
average
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
within
 
this
 
industry?
 
 
@35:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Well,
 
it
 
really
 
depends.
 
It
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
area.
 
But
 
once
 
the
 
ads
 
are
 
dialed
 
in,
 
you
 
can
 
expect
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
of
 
between
 
$11
 
to
 
$20.
 
 
@35:32
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
That's
 
the
 
average.
 
 
@35:33
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay?
 
That's
 
the
 
average.
 
Of
 
course,
 
it
 
also
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
landing
 
page.
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
landing
 
page
 
itself,
 
I
 
put
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
psychological
 
components
 
that
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
make
 
people
 
actually
 
want
 
to
 
leave
 
their
 
details.
 
I
 
am
 
not
 
a
 
fan
 
of
 
Katamine
 
Media's
 
landing
 
page.
 
Honestly,
 
it's
 
okay,
 
but
 
it's
 
just
 
not
 
doing
 
the
 
work
 
that
 
it's
 
supposed
 
to
 
do
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
psychological
 
pain
 
points.
 
And
 
also,
 
The
 
thing
 
is,
 
with
 
the
 
ads,
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
ads
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
harmony
 
with
 
the
 
landing
 
page.
 
I've
 
found
 
out
 
that
 
if
 
the
 
ads
 
are
 
good,
 
then
 
the
 
landing
 
page
 
matters
 
even
 
less
 
than
 
what
 
the
 
ads
 
do,
 
because
 
the
 
ads
 
do
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
work.
 
But
 
also
 
in
 
the
 
landing
 
page,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
elements
 
and
 
the
 
principles
 
to
 
get
 
people
 
to
 
actually
 
do
 
the
 
details.
 
Also,
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
fan
 
of
 
them
 
having
 
these
 
open
 
questions
 
here.
 
It
 
really
 
makes
 
it
 
difficult
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
leave
 
their
 
details,
 
these
 
open-ended
 
questions.
 
And
 
it's
 
just
 
that
 
it's
 
not
 
good
 
practice,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion.
 
Again,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
feel
 
like
 
I'm
 
shitting
 
on
 
them,
 
but
 
I
 
am
 
actually
 
shitting
 
on
 
them,
 
because
 
that's
 
the
 
truth.
 
So,
 
yeah.

Who
 
does
 
all
 
the
 
creative
 
design?

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
about
 
the
 
creative
 
design.
 
like
 
going
 
in
 
design.
 
I
 
don't
 
really
 
like
 
to
 
design
 
ads.
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
fan
 
of
 
designing
 
ads.
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
breaking
 
news
 
type
 
ad
 
that
 
I
 
showed
 
you,
 
which
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
template
 
of
 
it,
 
so
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
switch
 
the
 
picture,
 
honestly.
 
need
 
to
 
switch
 
the
 
picture,
 
switch
 
the
 
location,
 
and
 
I
 
mostly
 
love
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
having
 
an
 
image
 
that
 
catches
 
their
 
attention,
 
okay,
 
that
 
catches
 
their
 
attention,
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
read
 
the
 
ad,
 
or
 
when
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
video,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
need
 
any
 
design,
 
because
 
then
 
there's
 
the
 
video.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
editing
 
of
 
the
 
video
 
itself,
 
but
 
we
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
any
 
design.
 
So
 
I
 
love
 
to
 
use
 
authentic
 
images,
 
and
 
there's
 
a
 
very,
 
so
 
you
 
watched
 
the
 
video
 
about
 
the
 
bald
 
guy
 
that
 
I
 
analyzed
 
this
 
funnel?
 
 
@37:41
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
I
 
didn't
 
get
 
all
 
the
 
way
 
through,
 
except
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
longer.
 
 
@37:45

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
back
 
and
 
look
 
at
 
that,
 
but...
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
his
 
ads
 
for
 
a
 
second,
 
so
 
you
 
understand
 
exactly
 
what
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about,
 
because
 
he's
 
doing
 
a
 
phenomenal
 
job,
 
just
 
really
 
a
 
phenomenal
 
job.
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
who
 
runs
 
his
 
marketing,
 
but
 
it's
 
definitely
 
not
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
marketing
 
agencies
 
that...
 
That
 
are
 
operating,
 
because
 
to
 
run
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
ads,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
understanding
 
of
 
marketing.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you,
 
so
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
he's
 
running
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
video
 
ads.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
there's
 
a
 
picture
 
of
 
him,
 
picture
 
of
 
a
 
brain
 
here,
 
picture
 
of
 
neurons.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
how
 
do
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
these
 
ads
 
work?
 
Look
 
how
 
long
 
they've
 
been
 
running
 
for.
 
Four
 
months.
 
That's
 
how
 
you
 
know
 
an
 
ad
 
works,
 
because
 
he
 
doesn't
 
turn
 
them
 
off.
 
And
 
he
 
has
 
an
 
extremely
 
long
 
ad
 
here,
 
talks
 
about
 
his
 
story
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Look
 
at
 
this.
 
This
 
is
 
extremely
 
long,
 
and
 
it
 
works
 
unbelievably
 
well.
 
And
 
he
 
has
 
ads
 
of
 
him
 
talking
 
over
 
here.
 
I
 
believe
 
the
 
root
 
cause
 
of
 
why
 
we
 
get
 
depression
 
and
 
anxiety,
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
serotonin
 
deficiency,
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
chemical
 
imbalance.
 
That
 
doesn't
 
really
 
play
 
out
 
very
 
well
 
if
 
you
 
really
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
research.
 
So
 
And
 
yeah,
 
he's
 
just
 
every,
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
every
 
couple
 
of
 
months
 
he's
 
creating
 
new
 
ads.
 
So
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
the
 
last
 
batch
 
was
 
last
 
month.
 
And
 
he's
 
just
 
creating
 
new
 
ads
 
and
 
he
 
does
 
what
 
he
 
needs
 
to
 
do
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
marketing
 
psychology.
 
And
 
the.
 
the.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
watched
 
the
 
video.
 
really
 
going
 
deep
 
inside
 
his
 
funnel
 
and
 
understanding
 
exactly
 
what
 
he
 
does
 
there.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
really,
 
really
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
value.
 
I
 
truly
 
do
 
believe
 
in
 
that.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
basically
 
how
 
I
 
work.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
work.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
practicing
 
practice
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
put
 
inside
 
the
 
clinics
 
that
 
I
 
work
 
with,
 
creating
 
super
 
long,
 
educative
 
ads
 
that
 
make
 
people
 
understand
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
heal,
 
creating
 
belief
 
inside
 
people.
 
And
 
that's
 
it.
 
That's
 
the,
 
that's
 
the
 
main
 
purpose.
 
Very
 
efficient
 
with
 
what
 
I
 
do.
 
So
 
yeah.
 
 
@39:37
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
And
 
also
 
there's-
 
don't,
 
you
 
didn't,
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
run
 
his
 
ads,
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
along
 
the
 
lines
 
of
 
what
 
you're
 
trying
 
to
 
sort
 
of
 
create.
 
 
@39:45
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yep,
 
exactly
 
that.
 
I
 
wish
 
I
 
could
 
know
 
who's
 
running
 
his
 
ads
 
because
 
it's
 
a,
 
it's
 
a
 
very
 
strong,
 
I
 
believe
 
it's
 
a
 
direct
 
response
 
marketer
 
who
 
doesn't,
 
who
 
doesn't
 
like
 
focus
 
specifically
 
on
 
ketamine
 
or
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
because
 
it's
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
specific
 
type
 
of
 
knowledge
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
write
 
these
 
types
 
of
 
ads,
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
come
 
from
 
a
 
very
 
specific
 
world
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
very
 
much.
 
Salute
 
to
 
him.
 
I've
 
never
 
found
 
anybody
 
better
 
than
 
him,
 
honestly,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
ads.
 
 
@40:17
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Can
 
you
 
show
 
me
 
some
 
examples
 
of
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
images
 
that
 
you
 
do
 
tend
 
to
 
use
 
for
 
ads?
 
I'm
 
totally
 
game
 
for
 
video
 
content.
 
I
 
personally
 
would
 
watch
 
video
 
content
 
more
 
than
 
I
 
would
 
stop
 
on
 
an
 
ad.
 
But,
 
typically,
 
when
 
I
 
do
 
find
 
good
 
ads
 
on
 
social
 
media,
 
it's
 
just
 
a
 
striking
 
image
 
that
 
captures
 
my
 
attention
 
versus
 
stock
 
photography
 
of
 
smiling
 
people
 
with
 
their
 
arms
 
in
 
the
 
air,
 
right?
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
I
 
agree
 
with
 
you.
 
Really
 
annoyed
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
 
@40:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
understand.
 
So,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
graphics,
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
graphics
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
is
 
mainly
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
graphics
 
that,
 
again,
 
catch
 
the
 
eye.
 
So,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
This...
 
Maybe
 
something
 
like
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
again,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
picture
 
of
 
you,
 
the
 
breaking
 
news
 
type
 
ad
 
works
 
extremely
 
well.
 
And
 
also
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
tried
 
out,
 
which
 
didn't
 
really
 
work,
 
honestly,
 
it
 
didn't
 
really
 
work,
 
was
 
the
 
carousel
 
ad.
 
Okay.
 
As
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
I
 
tried
 
to
 
do
 
something
 
that
 
was
 
very
 
different.
 
So
 
if
 
you're
 
dealing
 
with
 
a
 
terrestrial
 
depression,
 
what
 
would
 
you
 
choose?
 
Another
 
pill
 
or
 
more
 
therapy,
 
right?
 
Or
 
more
 
therapy.
 
What
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
rely
 
on
 
either
 
and
 
actually
 
solve
 
the
 
problem
 
from
 
the
 
root?
 
Okay.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
read
 
the
 
post.
 
As
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
brand
 
new
 
concept
 
didn't
 
really
 
work.
 
Another
 
type
 
of
 
ad
 
that
 
I
 
ran.
 
So
 
I
 
worked
 
with
 
these
 
guys
 
at
 
BrainsteamTMS.
 
I
 
was
 
supposed
 
to
 
actually
 
partner
 
up
 
with
 
them.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
I
 
didn't
 
because
 
I
 
just
 
didn't
 
see
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
working
 
with
 
them.
 
They
 
wanted
 
to
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
marketing
 
agency
 
for
 
people.
 
And
 
it
 
was
 
like
 
two
 
people,
 
extremely
 
slow.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
I
 
just,
 
I
 
lifted
 
my
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
here's
 
one
 
testimonial
 
ads,
 
which
 
I
 
edited.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
it
 
wasn't
 
like
 
that,
 
it
 
was
 
like
 
four
 
minutes
 
long.
 
And
 
I
 
edited
 
that.
 
This
 
is
 
another
 
type
 
of
 
ad
 
that
 
we
 
use,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
new
 
option.
 
There's
 
a
 
new
 
option
 
for
 
children
 
who
 
resist
 
depression.
 
It's
 
getting
 
attention.
 
That's
 
another
 
one,
 
just
 
a
 
black
 
screen.
 
A
 
picture
 
of
 
this
 
woman
 
here,
 
for
 
example.
 
There's
 
only
 
one
 
who
 
will
 
resolve
 
depression
 
without
 
medicine
 
in
 
2025.
 
This
 
is
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
how.
 
By
 
the
 
way,
 
can
 
you
 
see
 
the
 
photos,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
need
 
me
 
to?
 
 
@42:32
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
can.
 
No,
 
that's
 
helpful.
 
I
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
gist
 
of
 
what
 
you
 
tend
 
to
 
lean
 
into.
 
 
@42:39
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
if
 
people
 
do
 
not
 
want
 
to
 
film
 
videos,
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
am
 
very,
 
very
 
stubborn
 
on
 
people
 
to
 
do
 
film
 
videos.
 
Like,
 
for
 
example,
 
they
 
didn't
 
even
 
want
 
to
 
film
 
videos.
 
They
 
didn't
 
want
 
to
 
film
 
videos.
 
 
@42:50
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
You
 
know?
 
Honestly,
 
there's
 
no
 
room.
 
It's
 
just
 
crazy.
 
I,
 
listen,
 
I
 
should
 
be,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
doubt
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
be.
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
a
 
good
 
marketing
 
team,
 
because
 
I
 
would
 
run
 
my
 
own
 
marketing,
 
I
 
just
 
don't
 
have
 
time
 
for
 
that,
 
nor
 
do
 
I
 
really
 
want
 
to,
 
but
 
compared
 
to
 
what
 
else
 
is
 
out
 
there,
 
I'm,
 
if
 
I
 
could
 
get
 
someone
 
to
 
execute
 
it
 
well,
 
right,
 
which
 
it
 
sounds
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
that's
 
what
 
you're
 
trying
 
to
 
do,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why
 
there's,
 
there's
 
no
 
reason
 
why
 
our
 
clinic
 
and
 
any
 
subsequent
 
clinic
 
we
 
open
 
isn't
 
successful.
 
It's
 
just,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why,
 
so
 
far
 
from
 
this
 
one
 
marketing
 
team,
 
I'm
 
not
 
getting
 
anything.
 
So,
 
you
 
did
 
mention
 
like
 
a,
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
cost,
 
obviously,
 
and
 
you
 
mentioned
 
something
 
about,
 
like
 
doing
 
a
 
one
 
month
 
trial,
 
give
 
me
 
the
 
spiel
 
on.
 
 
@43:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
it
 
works,
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
spending
 
for
 
the
 
ad
 
spend
 
as
 
well.
 
For
 
the
 
first
 
month,
 
what
 
we
 
do,
 
we
 
only
 
take
 
the
 
setup
 
cost,
 
okay,
 
so
 
only
 
to
 
set
 
up
 
the
 
ads,
 
do
 
the
 
foundations,
 
everything.
 
set
 
up
 
we're
 
that,
 
but
 
even
 
We
 
take
 
$7.97
 
for
 
that.
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
month,
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
happy
 
or
 
anything
 
of
 
that
 
sort,
 
I'm
 
not
 
giving
 
you
 
90
 
days.
 
30
 
days
 
is
 
exactly
 
a
 
good
 
time
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
whether
 
our
 
dynamic
 
works,
 
whether
 
you
 
see
 
progress
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Obviously,
 
we
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
as
 
time
 
goes
 
by,
 
but
 
after
 
a
 
month,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
bright
 
image
 
of
 
who
 
I
 
am,
 
how
 
I
 
work,
 
my
 
values,
 
because
 
I
 
can
 
sit
 
on
 
this
 
call
 
and
 
you
 
for
 
eternity.
 
In
 
the
 
end,
 
what
 
determines
 
if
 
I'm
 
good
 
or
 
not
 
is
 
one
 
month
 
of
 
you
 
working
 
with
 
me.
 
So
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
month,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
a
 
retainer.
 
On
 
the
 
second
 
month,
 
what
 
we
 
do,
 
we
 
have
 
two
 
options.
 
If
 
you
 
do
 
want
 
to
 
continue,
 
it's
 
either
 
$1,000
 
retainer
 
and
 
we
 
charge
 
per
 
every
 
consultation
 
a
 
$20
 
booking
 
fee.
 
So
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
month,
 
if
 
we
 
get
 
30
 
bookings,
 
we
 
get
 
$600
 
from
 
that.
 
Or
 
the
 
other
 
option
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
base
 
retainer
 
of
 
$1,250
 
a
 
month.
 
And
 
you
 
are
 
free
 
to
 
cancel
 
every...
 
...
 
Every
 
single
 
month,
 
there's
 
no
 
contracts,
 
nothing,
 
no,
 
anything
 
like
 
that.
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
believe
 
in
 
these
 
things.
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
they
 
create
 
a
 
bad
 
dynamic.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
so
 
that's,
 
that's
 
basically
 
as
 
simple
 
as
 
possible.
 
 
@45:14

Okay,
 
so
 
let
 
me
 
just
 
clarify
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
month,
 
there's
 
just
 
a
 
setup
 
cost
 
of
 
$7.97.
 
We
 
run
 
for
 
30
 
days,
 
about
 
$40
 
a
 
day
 
on
 
ads.
 
I
 
get
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
test
 
you
 
out,
 
see,
 
see
 
what
 
the
 
journey
 
looks
 
like.
 
Like,
 
if
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
continue,
 
I
 
can
 
go
 
to
 
$1,000
 
retainer
 
with
 
$20
 
per
 
consult
 
booked.
 
 
@45:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
correct.
 
 
@45:40
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Or
 
$1,250
 
retainer
 
flat
 
fee,
 
and
 
consult
 
booked
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
that,
 
correct?
 
 
@45:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes,
 
that's
 
correct.
 
 
@45:48
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
That's
 
right.
 
Okay.
 
Now,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
move
 
forward,
 
then
 
that
 
means
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
deactivate
 
my
 
contract,
 
correct?
 
With
 
my
 
current
 
team.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
got
 
to
 
figure
 
out
 
how
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
handle
 
that.
 
 
@46:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
them?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
90-day
 
contract
 
with
 
them?
 
 
@46:20
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Is
 
that
 
how
 
it
 
works?
 
I
 
don't
 
believe
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
contract
 
with
 
them,
 
actually.
 
They
 
are
 
supposed
 
to
 
be
 
handling...
 
They
 
built
 
my
 
website,
 
which
 
I'm
 
having
 
redone
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
really
 
happy
 
with
 
how
 
the
 
website
 
turned
 
out,
 
but
 
they
 
handle
 
all
 
the
 
SEO
 
and
 
blogs,
 
etc.
 
So
 
I
 
would
 
need
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
solution
 
for
 
that
 
piece
 
as
 
well.
 
If
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
run
 
ads,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
find
 
someone
 
who
 
can
 
handle
 
SEO
 
and
 
website
 
content.
 
 
@46:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
actually
 
working.
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
that
 
solution
 
yet,
 
but
 
I'm
 
really
 
trying
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
automate
 
these
 
things,
 
to
 
have
 
like
 
automatic
 
SEO.
 
So
 
that's,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's...
 
You
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
automation
 
that's
 
gonna
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
know
 
exactly,
 
you
 
know,
 
all
 
the
 
things,
 
all
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
come
 
into
 
having
 
good
 
SEO,
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
rank
 
on
 
ChatGPT
 
as
 
well,
 
because
 
it's
 
not
 
about
 
Google
 
anymore,
 
it's
 
about
 
ChatGPT.
 
 
@47:16
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So
 
I'm
 
really
 
working
 
on
 
a
 
system
 
for
 
that.
 
 
@47:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
find,
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
good
 
people
 
on
 
onlinejobs.ph.
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
can
 
do
 
a
 
good
 
job.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
search
 
that
 
up
 
as
 
well.
 
But
 
also,
 
in
 
general,
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
recommend
 
you
 
to
 
do
 
is,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
education
 
about
 
that
 
in
 
your
 
space.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
SEO
 
is
 
even
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
valuable
 
in
 
that
 
sense.
 
Because
 
if
 
people
 
are
 
not
 
educated
 
on
 
ketamine
 
and
 
TMS,
 
they're
 
not
 
even
 
going
 
to
 
search
 
that
 
up.
 
Did
 
they
 
do
 
keyword
 
research
 
in
 
your
 
area
 
about
 
the...
 
 
@47:50
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
that
 
report
 
back.
 
They
 
were
 
supposed
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
Right
 
now,
 
Google's
 
giving
 
us
 
a
 
runaround.
 
 
@47:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
not
 
even
 
listed
 
on
 
Google's
 
listing
 
at
 
the
 
moment.
 
So
 
there's,
 
there's
 
lots
 
of
 
problems.
 
 
@48:01
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
I'm
 
just
 
like...
 
 
@48:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
with
 
Google
 
My
 
Business.
 
 
@48:04
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
also
 
a
 
very
 
important
 
thing
 
to
 
do.
 
Yeah,
 
they're,
 
they're
 
making
 
it
 
very
 
difficult
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
verify
 
businesses
 
now,
 
just
 
because
 
I
 
think
 
there's
 
been
 
so
 
many
 
that
 
have
 
created
 
fake
 
businesses
 
just
 
to
 
capture
 
listings.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
I
 
will,
 
let
 
me,
 
I'm
 
interested.
 
You're
 
in
 
Israel.
 
So
 
the
 
hours
 
are
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
different.
 
 
@48:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
This
 
is
 
typically
 
when
 
you
 
meet
 
with
 
people,
 
though,
 
from
 
the
 
US,
 
I
 
take
 
it?
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
approximately.
 
I
 
usually,
 
I
 
usually
 
stop
 
working
 
around
 
this
 
time.
 
Around
 
this
 
time,
 
I
 
stop
 
working.
 
I
 
usually
 
work
 
from
 
the
 
morning
 
of
 
you
 
guys
 
until
 
around
 
about
 
this
 
time.
 
So
 
something
 
like
 
that.
 
And
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
specific
 
days
 
in
 
which
 
you're
 
not
 
available,
 
and
 
you
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call,
 
I
 
can
 
obviously
 
push
 
that
 
far
 
away.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
What
 
time
 
zone
 
are
 
you,
 
by
 
the
 
way?
 
 
@48:58
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
I'm
 
in
 
Mountain
 
Time
 
Zone.
 
 
@48:59

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
in
 
Colorado.
 
 
@49:00
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Okay.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
 
@49:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
love
 
Colorado,
 
by
 
the
 
way.
 
I
 
actually
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
visit
 
there.
 
I
 
don't
 
why.
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
the
 
U.S.
 
 
@49:11
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
in
 
general.
 
 
@49:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
like
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
but
 
Colorado
 
for
 
some
 
reason,
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
there's
 
something
 
there
 
with
 
nature
 
and
 
also
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
they're
 
okay
 
with
 
mushrooms
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
So,
 
it's
 
currently,
 
what,
 
is
 
it
 
now
 
12
 
for
 
you?
 
 
@49:30
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah,
 
1220.
 
So,
 
totally
 
fine.
 
What
 
time
 
is
 
it
 
for
 
you?
 
If
 
you
 
don't
 
mind
 
me
 
asking.
 
 
@49:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Is
 
it
 
late?
 
920.
 
 
@49:36
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
920.
 
Oh,
 
okay.
 
I'm
 
ending
 
your
 
day.
 
So,
 
I
 
need
 
to,
 
obviously,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
strategize
 
how
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
that
 
out
 
with
 
them
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
they're
 
willing
 
to
 
do.
 
I,
 
I
 
know
 
you've
 
just
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
for
 
four
 
months,
 
but
 
with
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
working
 
with,
 
how,
 
how
 
are
 
the
 
leads?
 
right.
 
Are
 
you
 
guys
 
getting
 
good
 
leads?
 
Do
 
they
 
feel
 
like,
 
are
 
they
 
actually
 
getting
 
converted
 
leads
 
from
 
the
 
ads
 
so
 
far?
 
 
@50:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
booking,
 
for
 
example,
 
for
 
this
 
clinic
 
that
 
I
 
showed
 
you
 
is
 
60
 
bucks.
 
60
 
bucks
 
cost
 
per
 
booking.
 
But
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
different
 
problem,
 
which
 
is
 
this
 
is
 
where
 
optimizing
 
comes
 
in
 
play.
 
They've
 
had
 
a
 
problem
 
which
 
they
 
booked
 
people
 
too
 
far
 
away,
 
like
 
one
 
week,
 
two
 
weeks
 
in
 
advance.
 
And
 
that
 
creates
 
a
 
show
 
rate
 
problem,
 
because
 
if
 
you
 
book
 
people
 
more
 
than
 
three,
 
four
 
days
 
ahead,
 
people
 
just
 
don't
 
show
 
up.
 
OK,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
we're
 
trying
 
to
 
optimize
 
to
 
get
 
people
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
faster,
 
giving
 
them
 
incentives
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
sooner,
 
getting
 
the
 
nurse
 
practitioners
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
and
 
take
 
their
 
consultations
 
if
 
the
 
provider
 
itself
 
or
 
the
 
doctor
 
cannot
 
do
 
it.
 
You
 
know,
 
so
 
there's
 
other
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
for,
 
because,
 
again,
 
it's
 
not
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
lead.
 
leads
 
to
 
respond.
 
The
 
leads
 
book
 
themselves.
 
The
 
front
 
desk
 
team
 
calls
 
them.
 
People
 
are
 
responsive.
 
But
 
again,
 
there's
 
like
 
bottlenecks
 
that
 
needs
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
solved
 
because
 
after
 
one.
 
One,
 
two
 
weeks,
 
people
 
just
 
get
 
cold,
 
so
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
optimize
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
to
 
contact
 
the
 
leads
 
as
 
fast
 
as
 
possible,
 
book
 
them
 
in
 
for
 
the
 
closest
 
time
 
as
 
possible
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
they're
 
always
 
wrong,
 
and
 
also
 
before
 
they
 
come
 
in,
 
having
 
the
 
proper
 
reminders
 
and
 
giving
 
them
 
value
 
before
 
they
 
come
 
in
 
and
 
giving
 
them
 
reassurance.
 
So
 
for
 
example,
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
love
 
you
 
to
 
do,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
maybe
 
a
 
pain
 
in
 
the
 
,
 
is
 
to,
 
a
 
day
 
before
 
people
 
come
 
inside
 
the
 
clinic,
 
send
 
them
 
a
 
video,
 
a
 
personalized
 
video
 
of
 
their
 
name.
 
Hi,
 
Sarah.
 
Just
 
wanted
 
to
 
let
 
you
 
know
 
that
 
I'm
 
extremely
 
excited
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
you
 
tomorrow
 
and
 
see
 
how
 
we
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
beat
 
XYZ.
 
And
 
that's
 
it.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
just
 
send
 
that.
 
Send
 
them
 
reminders.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
also
 
videos
 
that
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
answer
 
frequently
 
asked
 
questions.
 
So
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
whole,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
everything
 
set
 
up
 
in
 
place
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
people
 
are
 
feeling,
 
feeling
 
like
 
they
 
can
 
trust
 
you,
 
because
 
that's
 
very
 
important
 
with
 
the
 
state
 
of
 
mind
 
that
 
they're
 
in.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
that's.
 
 
@52:01
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
So
 
you
 
support
 
and
 
handle
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
chat
 
script
 
and
 
video
 
content
 
that's
 
nurturing
 
patients
 
until
 
they
 
come
 
in
 
the
 
door.
 
 
@52:13
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
correct.
 
So
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
creating
 
scripts
 
for
 
FAQs.
 
You'll
 
film
 
these
 
videos.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
edit
 
them.
 
They're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
very,
 
very
 
simple.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
put
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
thank
 
you
 
page.
 
Also,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
chat,
 
talking
 
with
 
people,
 
I'm
 
usually
 
keeping
 
it
 
simple.
 
There's
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
tools.
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
Katamimi
 
is
 
using
 
them.
 
Closebot,
 
for
 
example,
 
which
 
is
 
an
 
AI-type
 
AI
 
bot
 
that
 
talks
 
to
 
people
 
who
 
acts
 
like
 
a
 
human.
 
Haven't
 
implemented
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
Didn't
 
really
 
see
 
the
 
reason
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
But
 
that's
 
definitely
 
things.
 
These
 
are
 
definitely
 
things
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
done.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@52:51
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah.
 
Well,
 
I
 
worked
 
for
 
years
 
on
 
the
 
sales
 
team
 
of
 
a
 
coaching
 
program.
 
I'm
 
very
 
familiar
 
with
 
all
 
that.
 
I've
 
never
 
found
 
AI
 
that
 
did
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
job,
 
but
 
I
 
know.
 
Well,
 
that
 
the
 
industry
 
is
 
changing.
 
 
@53:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
maybe
 
there's
 
some
 
AI
 
out
 
there
 
that's
 
gotten,
 
that
 
has
 
learned
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
better.
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
give
 
them
 
a
 
knowledge
 
base.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
give
 
them
 
a
 
knowledge
 
base
 
and
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
correct
 
them
 
all
 
the
 
time.
 
And
 
once
 
you
 
do
 
that,
 
then
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
catch
 
the
 
stuff.
 
The
 
knowledge
 
base
 
is
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
helps
 
the
 
most.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@53:19
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
what
 
would
 
be
 
the
 
next
 
step
 
if
 
I
 
did
 
want
 
to
 
move
 
forward
 
just
 
to
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
you?
 
 
@53:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes,
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
me.
 
We
 
can
 
have
 
a
 
call
 
if
 
you
 
want,
 
explain
 
exactly
 
how
 
the
 
steps
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
It's
 
very
 
simple.
 
You're
 
going
 
to,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
payment
 
done.
 
You're
 
going
 
to
 
fill
 
out
 
the
 
onboarding
 
form.
 
After
 
you
 
fill
 
out
 
the
 
onboarding
 
form,
 
you're
 
going
 
have
 
six
 
steps
 
that
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
need
 
to
 
follow.
 
Two
 
to
 
three
 
minutes,
 
each
 
one
 
of
 
them.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
trouble,
 
you
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
Once
 
you
 
finish
 
with
 
the
 
steps,
 
we
 
book
 
a
 
call,
 
understand
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
If
 
you
 
need
 
any
 
help,
 
like
 
to,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
maximum
 
clarity
 
in
 
this
 
whole
 
process.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
from
 
there.
 
Okay.
 
As
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
my
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
go
 
live
 
within
 
seven
 
days.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we
 
can
 
start
 
getting
 
data,
 
understanding
 
what
 
works
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@54:03
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
All
 
right.
 
Fantastic.
 
Okay,
 
let
 
me
 
figure
 
out
 
what
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do,
 
or
 
how
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
execute
 
this,
 
but
 
I
 
appreciate
 
your
 
time
 
today,
 
Oriel,
 
and
 
yeah,
 
I
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
working
 
with
 
you
 
very
 
soon,
 
getting
 
this
 
going.
 
 
@54:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Me
 
too.
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
have
 
great
 
vibes.
 
I
 
like
 
that.
 
 
@54:24
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
So
 
awesome.
 
 
@54:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
touch
 
base
 
with
 
you
 
on
 
Monday,
 
or
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
me
 
a
 
message?
 
How
 
do
 
you
 
want,
 
where
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
take
 
this?
 
 
@54:35
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Can
 
I
 
text
 
you
 
at
 
that
 
number
 
that
 
you
 
were
 
sending?
 
That's
 
your
 
GHL
 
account?
 
 
@54:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yes.
 
 
@54:40
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Okay.
 
I
 
have,
 
I,
 
you
 
can
 
check
 
in
 
with
 
me
 
on
 
Monday.
 
If
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
an
 
answer
 
for
 
you
 
by
 
then,
 
definitely
 
be
 
by
 
the
 
middle
 
of
 
next
 
week,
 
what
 
I
 
decide
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do.
 
Yeah,
 
otherwise
 
I'll
 
definitely
 
read
 
 
@55:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that
 
sounds
 
cool.
 
 
@55:04
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Okay.
 
Yeah,
 
I'm,
 
I'm,
 
I'm
 
in
 
an
 
urgent
 
state.
 
So
 
I
 
promise
 
that
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
I'm
 
ready
 
to
 
press
 
go,
 
this
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
happen.
 
 
@55:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
yeah,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
know
 
from
 
my
 
side,
 
there's,
 
there's
 
no
 
pressure.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
step
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
way.
 
Don't,
 
don't
 
go
 
insane.
 
Okay.
 
Because
 
if
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
stressed,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
impact
 
you.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
just,
 
so
 
think
 
that
 
out,
 
sit,
 
understand
 
how
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
approach
 
them.
 
Once
 
you
 
got,
 
you
 
got
 
the
 
answers,
 
understand
 
the
 
process,
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
me.
 
If
 
you
 
need
 
any
 
help,
 
also
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
it
 
from
 
there.
 
 
@55:35
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
Have
 
you
 
worked
 
with
 
anyone
 
who
 
has
 
a
 
Brainsway
 
device
 
yet?
 
 
@55:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Particularly?
 
 
@55:42
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
No,
 
no,
 
no.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
All
 
right.
 
Well,
 
I'll
 
speak
 
to
 
them.
 
They,
 
they
 
cover
 
some
 
ad
 
budget
 
for
 
us
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
few
 
months.
 
 
@55:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
so
 
I'll
 
see
 
if
 
they're
 
willing
 
to
 
transition
 
that
 
ad
 
budget
 
over
 
to
 
you.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
lose
 
that.
 
Yeah.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
think
 
if
 
you're
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
ad
 
account,
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
why
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
problem
 
for
 
them,
 
because
 
if
 
you
 
run
 
from
 
the
 
same
 
ad
 
account,
 
then
 
I
 
believe
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
fine,
 
unless
 
that
 
there's
 
a
 
different
 
process
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that.
 
 
@56:12
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
There
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
different
 
process,
 
but
 
I'll
 
ask
 
my
 
contact
 
there
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
she
 
has
 
to
 
say.
 
 
@56:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
great.
 
 
@56:19
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
No
 
problem.
 
 
@56:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
right.
 
 
@56:21
 
-
 
Rosana
 
Graves
 
Okay,
 
thank
 
you
 
so
 
much,
 
Rosana.
 
you
 
so
 
much,
 
Oriel.
 
Yes,
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
evening.
 
We'll
 
talk
 
soon.
 
too.
 
You
 
too
 
have
 
a
 
great.
 
All
 
right,
 
bye-bye.
 
Bye-bye.

Great.
 
I'm

screen
 
today.

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
dive
 
straight
 
into
 
it.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
how
 
your
 
dog
 
is
 
doing
 
today.
 
So
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
I
 
saw
 
you
 
field
 
two
 
audits,
 
two
 
of
 
the
 
marketing
 
audits.
 
One
 
is
 
for
 
skin
 
treatments
 
I've
 
seen,
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
is
 
for
 
the
 
ketamine.
 
You
 
want
 
to?
 
 
@0:47
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone
 
16
 
Pro
 
Max
 
Sure.
 
Mm-hmm.
 
 
@0:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
about
 
that
 
a
 
bit?
 
 
@0:53
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone
 
16
 
Pro
 
Max
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
to
 
offer.
 
 
@0:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
why
 
we're
 
on
 
the
 
call.
 
Yeah.
 
Oh,
 
yeah.
 
But
 
before
 
I
 
can
 
offer
 
you
 
something,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
what
 
you're
 
doing
 
best.
 
Bye.
 
I've
 
done
 
some
 
research.
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
Instagram.
 
Sorry,
 
competitors.
 
So
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
a
 
bit
 
about
 
you
 
before.
 
 
@1:07
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone
 
16
 
Pro
 
Max
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
I'm
 
longevity
 
medicine,
 
wellness,
 
anesthesia,
 
pain
 
management
 
doctor.
 
been
 
practicing
 
for
 
over
 
20
 
years
 
and
 
expanding.
 
There
 
you
 
go.
 
 
@1:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
So
 
have
 
you
 
tried
 
marketing
 
in
 
the
 
past?
 
Are
 
you
 
doing
 
anything
 
right
 
now?
 
 
@1:24
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone
 
16
 
Pro
 
Max
 
Because
 
it
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
you
 
are.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
live
 
on
 
an
 
island
 
of
 
80,000
 
people.
 
So
 
it's
 
pretty
 
small
 
and
 
word
 
of
 
mouth.
 
And
 
I've
 
been
 
on
 
the
 
radio.
 
I've
 
done
 
some
 
newspaper
 
stuff.
 
But
 
I
 
haven't
 
done
 
like
 
social
 
media
 
marketing,
 
if
 
that's
 
the
 
question.
 
 
@1:45
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
because
 
in
 
the
 
audits
 
here,
 
I
 
see
 
that
 
you're
 
not
 
running
 
anything
 
right
 
now.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
other
 
audit,
 
you
 
say
 
that
 
you're
 
working
 
with
 
an
 
agency.
 
That's
 
why
 
I'm
 
asking,
 
because
 
you
 
have
 
two
 
different
 
answers
 
there.
 
 
@1:57
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone
 
16
 
Pro
 
Max
 
Sure.
 
So
 
I
 
have.
 
There
 
is
 
an
 
agency,
 
I
 
think
 
they're
 
an
 
agency,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
if
 
that's
 
what
 
they
 
call
 
themselves,
 
but
 
they
 
were
 
telling
 
me
 
we
 
could
 
run
 
all
 
these
 
ads
 
and
 
then
 
do,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
call
 
it,
 
like
 
weight
 
loss
 
stuff,
 
but
 
I
 
had
 
said,
 
like,
 
hey,
 
I
 
didn't
 
think
 
that
 
the
 
weight
 
loss
 
stuff
 
was
 
a
 
good
 
idea
 
for
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
different
 
reasons,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
turned
 
out
 
I
 
was
 
right.
 
So
 
nothing
 
really
 
kind
 
of
 
came
 
of
 
it,
 
if
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
But
 
they're
 
like,
 
well,
 
we
 
can
 
market
 
other
 
stuff
 
for
 
you.
 
But
 
nothing
 
has
 
been
 
done.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
they
 
actually,
 
you
 
know,
 
besides
 
the
 
weight
 
loss
 
niche,
 
which,
 
you
 
know,
 
people
 
are
 
being,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
call
 
it,
 
like,
 
sued
 
for
 
doing
 
compounding
 
and
 
stuff
 
now.-bye.
 
And
 
so
 
I'm
 
glad
 
I
 
never
 
got
 
into
 
it,
 
I
 
guess,
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
worry
 
about
 
it.
 
But
 
literally,
 
like
 
the
 
people
 
who
 
are
 
had
 
originally
 
said
 
they
 
would
 
do
 
ads
 
for
 
me
 
for
 
weight
 
loss
 
are
 
not
 
doing
 
that
 
anymore
 
and
 
are
 
trying
 
to
 
pivot.
 
So
 
I
 
guess
 
that's
 
the
 
answer
 
to
 
the
 
differential
 
parts
 
of
 
those
 
questions.

Okay,
 
so
 
you're
 
not
 
running
 
any
 
these
 
guys,
 
they
 
just
 
stopped
 
talking
 
to
 
you?
 
Did
 
you
 
pay
 
them
 
anything?

No,
 
no,
 
I
 
don't
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
into
 
that
 
with
 
you.
 
don't
 
really
 
think
 
I
 
need
 
to.
 
But
 
like,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
still
 
talking
 
to
 
them.
 
And
 
we
 
still
 
have
 
a
 
report.
 
It's
 
just
 
that
 
they
 
got
 
freaked
 
out
 
because
 
other
 
people
 
were
 
getting
 
sued.
 
And
 
I
 
said,
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
told
 
you
 
guys,
 
I
 
thought
 
that
 
might
 
happen,
 
given
 
everything
 
that
 
was
 
going
 
on.
 
And
 
so
 
we
 
said
 
we
 
would
 
pivot.
 
And
 
I
 
just
 
nothing
 
has
 
been
 
done
 
to
 
this
 
point.
 
So
 
because
 
I
 
think
 
like
 
their
 
whole
 
gig
 
was
 
based
 
off
 
of
 
weight
 
loss.
 
And
 
that's...
 
that's...
 
And
 
that's...
 
I'm
 
giving
 
them
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
pivot.

Okay,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
because
 
you
 
did
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
steps
 
to
 
get
 
on
 
this
 
call
 
with
 
me.
 
Okay,
 
you
 
saw
 
my
 
ad,
 
my
 
ad
 
is
 
not
 
short
 
at
 
all.
 
You
 
read
 
through
 
the
 
whole
 
ad,
 
you
 
submitted
 
information,
 
submitted
 
marketing
 
audit.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
from
 
you,
 
like,
 
what
 
you
 
see
 
in
 
the
 
ad
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
made
 
you
 
think
 
like
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
something
 
that
 
is
 
of
 
interest
 
because
 
there
 
are
 
other
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
competitors,
 
obviously,
 
I'm
 
sure
 
you've
 
seen
 
ads
 
of
 
them
 
too.
 
So
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
reason
 
that
 
you
 
specifically
 
hopped
 
on
 
with
 
me?
 
Or
 
you
 
just
 
thought,
 
Oh,
 
this
 
looks
 
cool.

for

for
 
me
 
to
 
understand,
 
first
 
of

why
 
you

Yeah,
 
but
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
Well,
 
the
 
time
 
when
 
I
 
saw
 
the
 
ad,
 
and
 
I
 
read
 
through
 
it,
 
I
 
obviously
 
was

this
 
could
 
be
 
good

interesting,
 
or
 
I
 
found
 
something
 
appealing.
 
not
 
feeling
 
about...

at
 
the

Do
 
I

what

No.
 
Okay.
 
Makes

So
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
you're
 
a
 
very
 
direct
 
person.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
straight
 
into
 
it.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
I
 
work,
 
how
 
my
 
brain
 
works.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
copywriting
 
is.
 
I'm
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
fan
 
of
 
marketing
 
psychology
 
and,
 
you
 
know,
 
copywriting
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
That's
 
also
 
probably
 
a
 
reason
 
why
 
the
 
ad
 
appealed
 
to
 
you.

And
 
if

something
 
about

on

I
 
was

an

I
 
do

which
 
is

And
 
I
 
do
 
feel
 
like
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
marketing
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
getting
 
people's
 
feelings
 
involved

kind
 
of
 
bringing

@5:58
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yep.
 
Exactly
 
that.
 
If
 
you
 
remember...
 
CARE
 
Framework
 
by
 
any
 
chance,
 
four
 
words,
 
you
 
remember
 
the
 
acronym?
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
basically,
 
yeah,
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
is
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
ads
 
that
 
I
 
wrote
 
for
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
my
 
clients,
 
show
 
you
 
some
 
results,
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
I
 
track
 
results,
 
how
 
we
 
track
 
things,
 
if
 
things
 
are
 
working
 
or
 
not
 
working,
 
and
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
So
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
work,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
structure
 
to
 
my
 
ads,
 
okay?
 
There's
 
a
 
thing
 
for
 
me
 
called
 
hooks,
 
okay?
 
And
 
the
 
hook
 
is
 
basically
 
the
 
first
 
five
 
to
 
ten
 
seconds
 
of
 
an
 
ad.
 
And
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
I
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
do
 
videos,
 
okay?
 
I
 
sometimes
 
do
 
static
 
ads,
 
but
 
static
 
ads
 
just
 
don't
 
get
 
the
 
same
 
result
 
as
 
video
 
ads.
 
So
 
we
 
basically
 
have
 
the
 
hooks.
 
You
 
film
 
all
 
the
 
hooks,
 
okay?
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
script,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
stand
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
the
 
camera,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
guides,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
and
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
film
 
all
 
the
 
hooks.
 
And
 
then
 
the
 
point
 
of
 
the
 
hooks
 
is
 
to
 
see
 
which
 
message
 
resonates
 
the
 
most
 
with
 
our
 
audience,
 
okay?
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
there's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
things
 
here.
 
There's
 
only
 
one
 
real
 
way
 
to
 
solve
 
the...
 
Over
 
21
 
million
 
U.S.
 
adults,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
say
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
hook
 
here
 
that
 
starts
 
with
 
the
 
area,
 
then
 
they're
 
saying
 
there's
 
a
 
new
 
depression,
 
that
 
is
 
a
 
new
 
depression
 
treatment,
 
but
 
I've
 
seen
 
a
 
92%
 
response
 
for
 
some
 
patients
 
within
 
three
 
weeks,
 
you
 
see,
 
you
 
attack
 
it
 
from
 
different
 
angles,
 
see
 
what
 
appeals
 
to
 
people
 
the
 
most,
 
and
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
there's
 
a
 
really,
 
really
 
cool
 
thing
 
now,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you're
 
up
 
to
 
AI
 
news,
 
there's
 
a
 
thing
 
called
 
VO3
 
by
 
Google,
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
actually
 
create
 
hooks
 
and
 
video
 
hooks
 
from
 
Google
 
itself,
 
and
 
it
 
got
 
really,
 
really
 
good.

Okay.
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
kind
 
of
 
expensive,
 
but
 
it
 
doesn't
 
matter.
 
Anyways,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
body
 
here,
 
and
 
the
 
body
 
is
 
basically
 
the
 
concept
 
of
 
the
 
ad,
 
and
 
what's
 
the
 
concept?
 
It's
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
our
 
message
 
across
 
and
 
shift
 
the
 
person's
 
mindset,
 
and
 
what
 
I
 
love
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
I
 
love
 
to
 
see
 
people
 
through
 
a
 
journey
 
inside
 
the
 
ad.
 
So
 
what
 
does
 
that
 
mean?
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
I
 
acknowledge
 
what
 
they
 
did.
 
I
 
acknowledge...
 
It's
 
a
 
situation
 
that
 
they're
 
at,
 
so
 
you
 
see
 
you've
 
done
 
the
 
therapy,
 
taken
 
the
 
meds,
 
you've
 
told
 
yourself
 
to
 
hang
 
in
 
there
 
more
 
times
 
than
 
you
 
can
 
count,
 
but
 
nothing
 
really
 
changed,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
touch
 
about
 
what
 
they
 
feel,
 
because
 
for
 
people
 
that
 
we
 
talk
 
to
 
specifically,
 
they
 
feel
 
like
 
depression
 
is
 
their
 
personality,
 
because
 
they're
 
being
 
labeled
 
as
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression,
 
which
 
is,
 
in
 
their
 
head,
 
that's
 
it,
 
I'm
 
a
 
depression
 
person
 
now,
 
but
 
we
 
tell
 
them
 
that
 
it's
 
not
 
their
 
fault,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
and
 
second
 
thing
 
is
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
another
 
way
 
to
 
solve
 
it.
 
Okay,
 
we
 
explain
 
why
 
they
 
went
 
through
 
what
 
they
 
went
 
through
 
up
 
until
 
now,
 
why
 
they
 
couldn't
 
solve
 
it,
 
and
 
why
 
traditional
 
treatments
 
could
 
not
 
solve
 
it,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
solution,
 
we
 
tell
 
them
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
another
 
way
 
out,
 
specifically
 
with
 
this
 
person,
 
he
 
offers
 
TMS,
 
do
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
TMS
 
is?
 
Yes.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
he
 
specifically
 
offers
 
TMS,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
start
 
talking
 
about
 
TMS,
 
what
 
it
 
does,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
it's
 
covered
 
by
 
studies,
 
and
 
you
 
know,
 
all
 
the
 
things,
 
and
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
results,
 
and
 
all
 
Where
 
did
 
you
 
and
 
that
 
And
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
it,
 
we
 
are,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
very,
 
very
 
important
 
point,
 
so
 
we
 
have,
 
as
 
I
 
told
 
you,
 
we
 
acknowledge
 
them,
 
tell
 
them
 
why
 
they
 
couldn't
 
fix
 
it,
 
we
 
show
 
them
 
the
 
fix,
 
fix,
 
and
 
quote-unquote,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
provide
 
proof.
 
The
 
proof
 
is
 
super,
 
super
 
crucial.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
patient
 
testimonials?
 
I've
 
seen
 
your
 
website,
 
I've
 
seen
 
the
 
testimonial
 
section.
 
It's
 
not
 
good,
 
I'll
 
be
 
honest.
 
It's
 
just
 
a
 
plain
 
text.
 
It's
 
not,
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
message
 
across.
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
patient
 
testimonials
 
by
 
any
 
chance,
 
anything
 
that
 
you've
 
ever
 
done
 
before,
 
or?

I
 
mean,
 
have
 
patient
 
testimonials,
 
but
 
they're
 
for
 
my
 
pain
 
practice,
 
not
 
for
 
the
 
wellness
 
and
 
longevity
 
and
 
that
 
practice,
 
because
 
that
 
part
 
of
 
the

is
 
new.

Okay,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
clients
 
in
 
that
 
space
 
currently,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
even
 
have
 
clients
 
there?

Right.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
have
 
people
 
who
 
definitely
 
are
 
saying
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
see
 
me.
 
They're
 
into
 
doing
 
the
 
concierge
 
medicine.
 
They
 
know
 
that
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
cash
 
pay.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
like
 
anything.
 
I've
 
been
 
on
 
the
 
island
 
for
 
10
 
years,
 
so
 
people
 
know
 
me.
 
They
 
know
 
Dr.
 
Sparks.
 
It's
 
not
 
that
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
clients.
 
It's
 
who's
 
going
 
to
 
pivot
 
and
 
who's
 
going
 
to
 
say,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
find
 
somebody
 
who
 
will
 
still
 
take
 
my
 
good
 
old
 
insurance
 
card
 
versus
 
somebody.
 
who
 
wants
 
to
 
pay
 
cash.
 
I
 
mean,
 
there's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
people
 
who
 
are
 
like,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
like,
 
she's,
 
doctors
 
leave
 
Kauai
 
all
 
the
 
time.
 
And
 
I've
 
been
 
there
 
for
 
10
 
years.
 
So
 
that
 
in
 
itself
 
speaks
 
volumes,
 
you
 
know,
 
yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@10:44

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that
 
gives
 
me
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
understanding
 
of
 
what's
 
going
 
on.
 
Cool.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
basically,
 
we
 
show
 
the
 
proof
 
because
 
for
 
people
 
with
 
depression,
 
essentially,
 
when
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
these
 
people,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
high
 
sophistication
 
level,
 
and
 
they're
 
very
 
skeptical.
 
We
 
show
 
proof.
 
Because
 
they've
 
tried
 
so
 
many
 
things
 
and
 
nothing
 
worked.
 
So
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
prove
 
to
 
them
 
by
 
using
 
other
 
people's
 
stories
 
and
 
success
 
that
 
they
 
could
 
get
 
another
 
result.
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
ads
 
that
 
we
 
also
 
do
 
that
 
is
 
specifically
 
based
 
on
 
client's
 
journey.
 
So
 
let
 
me
 
find
 
that
 
doc
 
over
 
here.
 
So
 
there's
 
this
 
company
 
called
 
Joyce,
 
which
 
I
 
made
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
ads
 
for
 
them.
 
And
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
on
 
the
 
left
 
here,
 
we
 
have
 
basically
 
the
 
same
 
format.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
hooks
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
this
 
ad,
 
for
 
example,
 
is
 
focusing
 
on
 
a
 
patient
 
called
 
Theathomis,
 
which
 
is
 
completely
 
real.
 
 
@11:39

Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone

By
 
the
 
way,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
made
 
up.
 
 
@11:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
our
 
story
 
here
 
basically
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
as
 
the
 
journey
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
through
 
here,
 
but
 
we
 
attack
 
it
 
from
 
a
 
different
 
angle.
 
We're
 
using
 
a
 
person's
 
story.
 
And
 
in
 
my
 
experience,
 
using
 
stories
 
from
 
other
 
people
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
in
 
your
 
situation
 
works
 
way
 
better
 
than
 
Everything
 
else.
 
It's,
 
basic
 
human
 
psychology.
 
So,
 
again,
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
what
 
she
 
did,
 
how
 
her
 
life
 
was,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
say
 
that
 
it
 
doesn't
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
like
 
that
 
anymore.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
introduce
 
the
 
solution,
 
and
 
again,
 
proof,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
know,
 
patient
 
testimonial,
 
patient
 
testimonial,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
too.
 
So,
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
types
 
of
 
ads
 
that
 
I'm
 
creating.
 
This
 
is
 
how
 
I'm
 
approaching
 
ads.
 
I'm
 
not
 
trying
 
to
 
reinvent
 
the
 
wheel.
 
I'm
 
not
 
that
 
person.
 
I
 
just
 
do
 
what
 
works
 
and
 
I
 
replicate
 
that
 
again
 
and
 
again
 
and
 
again.
 
And
 
that's
 
it.
 
So,
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
my
 
ads
 
work.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you've
 
done
 
some
 
research
 
about
 
me
 
or
 
if
 
you
 
looked
 
into
 
Instagram.
 
If
 
you
 
remember
 
from
 
the
 
ad,
 
I
 
am,
 
by
 
the
 
way,
 
full
 
transparency,
 
I'm
 
from
 
Israel,
 
I'm
 
not
 
from
 
the
 
US,
 
okay,
 
I
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
US
 
market,
 
and
 
in
 
Israel,
 
I've
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
marketing
 
industry
 
for
 
about
 
four
 
years,
 
and
 
in
 
Israel,
 
because
 
the
 
market
 
is
 
very,
 
very
 
small,
 
you
 
cannot
 
choose,
 
oh,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
these
 
people,
 
and
 
these
 
people,
 
and
 
that
 
people,
 
no,
 
you
 
need
 
work
 
with
 
everybody
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
is
 
willing
 
to
 
pay
 
you
 
money
 
and
 
has
 
a
 
good
 
product,
 
and
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
blah,
 
so
 
I
 
worked
 
with
 
over
 
150
 
clients
 
in
 
63
 
different
 
industries,
 
and
 
again,
 
it's
 
focusing
 
on
 
the
 
point
 
of
 
the
 
psychology
 
itself,
 
of
 
the
 
marketing,
 
so,
 
if
 
the,
 
I'm
 
focusing
 
my
 
marketing,
 
and
 
my
 
messaging,
 
and
 
my
 
content,
 
specifically
 
for
 
people
 
that
 
offer
 
ketamine,
 
TMS,
 
psychedelic
 
therapy,
 
you
 
know,
 
Spravato,
 
all
 
these
 
things,
 
but
 
I
 
do
 
have
 
the
 
ability,
 
obviously,
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
things
 
that
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
branch
 
of
 
wellness,
 
it
 
just
 
depends
 
on
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
things,
 
it
 
depends
 
on
 
your
 
product,
 
it
 
depends
 
on
 
you,
 
who
 
are
 
you
 
as
 
a
 
person,
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
high
 
ticket,
 
product,
 
That's
 
the
 
main
 
thing,
 
that
 
is
 
the
 
differentiator.
 
Because
 
copywriting
 
and
 
psychology,
 
I
 
know
 
the
 
root
 
of
 
it.
 
So
 
it
 
doesn't
 
matter,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
kind
 
of
 
business
 
comes
 
to
 
me.
 
I
 
just
 
would
 
rather,
 
obviously,
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
people
 
because
 
I
 
can
 
replicate
 
the
 
same
 
ads,
 
I
 
can
 
basically
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
ads
 
and
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
iterate
 
between
 
clients.
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
main
 
reason.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?

Mm-mm.
 
 
@14:35

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
cool.
 
Now
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
the
 
ads.
 
Now
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
I
 
work
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
data
 
tracking.
 
How
 
do
 
we
 
know
 
that
 
what
 
we
 
do
 
actually
 
works?
 
So
 
there's
 
two
 
things
 
that
 
we
 
do.
 
First
 
things
 
first,
 
we
 
go,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
eye
 
overview,
 
because
 
that's
 
more
 
important.
 
So
 
what
 
we
 
do,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
sample
 
here
 
of
 
a
 
client
 
of
 
mine,
 
in
 
which
 
we,
 
every
 
single
 
month,
 
we
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
say,
 
set
 
a
 
target.
 
Okay,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
understand,
 
okay,
 
what's
 
our
 
main
 
program?
 
The
 
price
 
of
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
advertising.
 
How
 
much
 
money
 
do
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
spend?
 
And
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
stats
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
get?
 
What
 
are
 
the
 
stats
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
achieve?
 
Okay,
 
so
 
for
 
example,
 
here
 
we
 
have
 
200
 
leads.
 
We
 
want,
 
if
 
we
 
spend
 
$3,000,
 
the
 
cost
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
$15.
 
Then
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
understand,
 
okay,
 
how
 
many
 
leads
 
have
 
showed
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
first
 
initial
 
call?
 
Then
 
after
 
that,
 
how
 
many
 
consoles
 
have
 
been
 
booked?
 
Then
 
after
 
that,
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
showed
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
clinic?
 
And
 
then
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
care
 
about,
 
we
 
care
 
about,
 
but
 
the
 
most
 
is
 
how
 
many
 
patients
 
we
 
got
 
signed?
 
And
 
what
 
is
 
our
 
cash
 
collected?
 
And
 
we
 
set
 
our
 
targets.
 
But
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
month,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
these
 
stats
 
and
 
understand,
 
okay,
 
did
 
we
 
hit
 
the
 
goal?
 
Did
 
we
 
not
 
hit
 
the
 
goal?
 
If
 
not,
 
why?
 
Where
 
are
 
our
 
bottlenecks?
 
Where
 
do
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
improve?
 
What
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
differently?
 
Okay.
 
So
 
that's
 
like
 
the
 
high
 
level
 
overview.
 
And
 
then
 
when
 
you
 
go
 
to
 
low.

how

I
 
understand
 
the
 
cost
 
for
 
leads,
 
but
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
wondering,
 
I
 
mean,
 
they
 
just
 
don't
 
look
 
like
 
great
 
numbers
 
at
 
all.

I
 
was
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
like-
 
This
 
is
 
sample
 
data.
 
This
 
is
 
sample
 
data.
 
Oh,
 
okay.
 
I
 
would
 
not
 
give
 
you
 
actual
 
stats
 
of,
 
like,
 
my
 
client
 
right
 
here.
 
It's
 
not,
 
it's
 
not
 
the
 
place
 
and
 
not
 
the
 
time.
 
Okay.
 
Bye
 
I
 
can
 
show
 
you
 
campaigns
 
that
 
we're
 
running,
 
but
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
an
 
in-depth
 
overview
 
of
 
my
 
client.
 
This
 
also
 
says
 
sample
 
here
 
on
 
the
 
bottom
 
left,
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
see.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
so
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
set
 
the
 
targets
 
and
 
then
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
our
 
stats
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
month.
 
Very,
 
very
 
simple.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
and
 
besides
 
that,
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
every
 
two
 
weeks,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
in-depth
 
into
 
every
 
single
 
ad
 
that
 
we're
 
running
 
because
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
run
 
multiple
 
ads,
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
multiple
 
hooks,
 
multiple
 
different
 
variations,
 
multiple
 
bodies.
 
And
 
every
 
two
 
weeks,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
inside
 
every
 
single
 
ad
 
and
 
understand,
 
OK,
 
what
 
are
 
our
 
metrics?
 
How
 
much
 
money
 
did
 
we
 
spend?
 
How
 
many
 
impressions
 
did
 
we
 
get?
 
How
 
many
 
landing
 
page
 
views?
 
How
 
many
 
leads?
 
What's
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
lead?
 
Conversion
 
rate?
 
All
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
inside
 
each
 
and
 
every
 
ad
 
and
 
understand,
 
OK,
 
how
 
do
 
they
 
perform
 
and
 
see
 
which
 
ads
 
work
 
best
 
and
 
which
 
ads
 
not
 
work.
 
And
 
we
 
just
 
turn
 
off
 
what
 
doesn't
 
work
 
and
 
we
 
iterate
 
and
 
keep
 
on
 
working
 
and
 
duplicating.
 
It
 
does
 
work.
 
So
 
extremely
 
simple
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?

Mm-hmm.
 
 
@18:09

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
yeah,
 
two
 
main
 
parts.
 
One
 
is
 
the
 
ads,
 
two
 
is
 
data
 
tracking.
 
And
 
we
 
also
 
have
 
here,
 
this
 
is
 
specifically
 
my
 
account,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
what's
 
called
 
a
 
platform
 
called
 
Go
 
High
 
Level.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
an
 
account
 
here
 
that
 
is
 
white
 
labeled
 
on
 
me,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
great
 
stuff
 
here.
 
So
 
you
 
will
 
need,
 
we
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
connect
 
to
 
this
 
account,
 
we
 
have
 
calendars
 
here,
 
automations,
 
we
 
will
 
connect
 
to
 
Facebook,
 
Instagram,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
see
 
all
 
the
 
leads
 
over
 
here,
 
like
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
people
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
here,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
pipelines
 
inside
 
here
 
as
 
well.
 
Let
 
me
 
share
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
Yeah,
 
just
 
a
 
second.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
pipelines
 
here,
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
see
 
as
 
an
 
example,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
here.
 
And
 
yeah,
 
this
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
platform
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
using.
 
Does
 
that
 
make
 
Since
 
it's
 
a
 
bit
 
overwhelming,
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
into
 
everything
 
here
 
now.
 
It's
 
a
 
very,
 
very
 
complicated
 
platform.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
show
 
you,
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
exactly
 
how
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
So
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
Let's
 
see
 
if
 
there's
 
anything
 
else
 
that
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
over.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
any
 
specific
 
questions,
 
something
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
see,
 
you
 
know,
 
ask
 
me?
 
 
@19:27

No,
 
I'm
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
follow
 
it
 
along.
 
 
@19:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
things
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
focusing
 
on.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
main
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
show
 
you.
 
wanted
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
clarity.
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
how
 
I
 
think.
 
Second
 
of
 
all,
 
how
 
I
 
track
 
data.
 
Third
 
of
 
all,
 
where
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
working.
 
How
 
are
 
you
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
managing
 
the
 
leads?
 
Where
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
details?
 
What
 
platform
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
using?
 
I
 
mean,
 
and
 
that,
 
that
 
is,
 
that
 
is
 
mainly
 
it
 
about
 
that.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
anything
 
that
 
you,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
know,
 
you
 
can
 
tell
 
me.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
every,
 
I
 
can,
 
I
 
can
 
answer
 
every
 
question,
 
basically.
 
 
@19:59

you.
 
 
@20:04
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
I
 
don't
 
really
 
have
 
any
 
questions.
 
 
@20:09
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone

I
 
think
 
I
 
get
 
it
 
and
 
understand
 
it,
 
and
 
yeah.
 
 
@20:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
let
 
me
 
ask
 
you
 
now,
 
is
 
there
 
anything
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
from
 
me
 
to
 
keep
 
moving
 
forward?
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
the
 
pricing?
 
Let
 
me
 
know
 
what
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do.
 
So,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
kind
 
of
 
need
 
you
 
to
 
communicate
 
with
 
me
 
here.
 
 
@20:33
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone

I
 
mean,
 
I
 
jumped
 
on
 
the
 
call.
 
I
 
heard
 
what
 
you
 
had
 
to
 
say.
 
I
 
understand
 
your
 
system.
 
I
 
see
 
what
 
it's
 
about.
 
I'm
 
not
 
someone
 
who's
 
going
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
decision
 
this
 
minute.
 
 
@20:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@20:48
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone

Pro
 
Max
 
to
 
evaluate
 
things
 
and
 
think
 
of
 
things
 
and
 
sleep
 
on
 
them
 
and
 
let
 
them
 
marinate
 
my
 
brain.
 
 
@20:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that
 
makes
 
complete
 
sense.
 
There's
 
no
 
problem
 
with
 
that,
 
obviously.
 
He
 
could
 
have
 
said
 
that.
 
that.
 
Let's
 
You
 
accept
 
that,
 
obviously.
 
Is
 
there
 
anything
 
else
 
that
 
you...
 
 
@21:07
 
-
 
Sparklie
 
Sparks
 
Iphone
 
16
 
Pro
 
Max
 
You
 
said
 
you
 
completely
 
accept
 
that,
 
and
 
I'm
 
like,
 
well,
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
choice
 
because
 
that's
 
the
 
way
 
I
 
operate
 
my
 
businesses,
 
so
 
that's
 
how
 
I'll
 
accept
 
it
 
or
 
not.
 
If
 
you
 
didn't
 
accept
 
it,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
tell
 
you.
 
It
 
is
 
what
 
it
 
is,
 
right?
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
this
 
time
 
to
 
process
 
it.
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
understand.
 
You
 
gave
 
me
 
a
 
good
 
synopsis,
 
I
 
guess,
 
of
 
how
 
you
 
process
 
and
 
how
 
you
 
run,
 
and
 
I
 
appreciate
 
the
 
time,
 
and
 
I
 
will
 
consider
 
it
 
for
 
everything
 
we're
 
doing
 
for
 
marketing.
 
 
@21:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
Yeah,
 
sure.
 
Well,
 
you
 
can
 
talk
 
to
 
me,
 
touch
 
base
 
with
 
me,
 
whatever
 
you
 
want.
 
I'm
 
here.
 
By
 
the
 
way,
 
I've
 
heard
 
from
 
your
 
tone.
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
be
 
completely
 
honest.
 
For
 
some
 
reason,
 
you
 
sound
 
defensive.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why.
 
I
 
am
 
just
 
offering
 
you
 
what
 
I
 
have.
 
I
 
don't
 
why
 
you
 
became
 
defensive.
 
This
 
is
 
actually
 
a
 
red
 
flag
 
for
 
me.
 
I'll
 
be
 
completely
 
honest.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
think,
 
you
 
can
 
sleep
 
on
 
it.
 
I'm
 
here
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
contact
 
me
 
and
 
continue,
 
want
 
to
 
speak
 
forward,
 
hop
 
on
 
another
 
call.
 
And
 
that
 
is
 
basically
 
it.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
you're
 
free
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
me.
 
Let
 
me
 
know
 
now.
 
I
 
appreciate
 
it.
 
Thanks
 
so
 
much.
 
you.
 
Bye-bye.
 
Aloha.
 
Bye.-bye.

Michael
 
This
 
meeting
 
is
 
being
 
recorded.
 
is
 
a
 
hard
 
question,
 
but
 
I
 
do
 
have
 
a
 
bunch
 
anyway.
 
So
 
I
 
guess
 
there's
 
a
 
few.
 
I'm
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
open
 
about
 
some
 
of
 
my
 
concerns
 
along
 
the
 
way,
 
I
 
guess,
 
that
 
I
 
have.
 
First
 
of
 
you're
 
an
 
independent
 
person
 
on
 
your
 
own,
 
I
 
guess
 
handling
 
multiple
 
companies.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
something
 
that
 
you
 
handle
 
and
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
handle
 
whatever
 
volume
 
you're
 
coming
 
in.
 
And
 
then
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
become
 
like
 
sort
 
of
 
over
 
time,
 
you
 
know,
 
something
 
where
 
it
 
gets
 
less
 
and
 
less.
 
Like,
 
for
 
example,
 
how
 
often
 
are
 
we
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
touch
 
and
 
how
 
regularly
 
can
 
I
 
get
 
in
 
touch
 
with
 
you
 
were
 
we
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
something?
 
How
 
would
 
that
 
work
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
your
 
accessibility
 
and
 
the
 
like?
 
 
@1:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
a
 
great
 
question.
 
I
 
like
 
that.
 
So
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
right
 
now?
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
Israeli
 
clients,
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
people
 
from
 
the
 
U.S.
 
that
 
I'm
 
starting
 
to
 
work
 
with.
 
I
 
do
 
the
 
transition
 
to
 
the
 
U.S.
 
I'm
 
stopping
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
Israel.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
stop
 
working
 
with
 
Israel.
 
That's
 
the
 
first
 
thing.
 
Second
 
thing,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
our
 
accessibility
 
and
 
communication,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
Slack.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
WhatsApp,
 
can
 
do
 
WhatsApp.
 
If
 
you
 
want
 
messages,
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
messages.
 
On
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
calendar
 
in
 
which
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
me,
 
you'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
me
 
whenever
 
you
 
want.
 
OK,
 
it's
 
pretty
 
simple.
 
And
 
as
 
time
 
goes
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
three
 
months,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
hire
 
people,
 
obviously.
 
But
 
these
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
A
 
players
 
at
 
some
 
point
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
three
 
months.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
hire
 
a
 
client
 
success
 
manager.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
train
 
to
 
be
 
basically
 
a
 
clone
 
of
 
me,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
change
 
anything
 
about
 
your
 
results.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
me
 
checking
 
the
 
ads.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
check
 
the
 
ads
 
regularly
 
all
 
the
 
time.
 
doesn't
 
really
 
matter
 
until
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
I
 
trust
 
that
 
will
 
do
 
it,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
instead
 
of
 
me.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
shooting
 
days
 
once
 
a
 
month
 
or
 
once
 
a
 
month
 
and
 
a
 
half.
 
So
 
we're
 
always
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
new
 
ads
 
and
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
keep
 
on
 
having
 
the
 
calls
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
data
 
and
 
the
 
stats,
 
see
 
what
 
we
 
can
 
improve
 
on.
 
It's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
stop.
 
It's
 
like,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
this
 
relationship
 
is
 
based
 
on,
 
you
 
long
 
term.
 
And
 
also
 
when
 
you're
 
happy,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I'm
 
comfortable
 
because
 
I
 
have,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
to
 
a
 
point
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
have,
 
as
 
I
 
told
 
you,
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
30
 
clients
 
that
 
these
 
30
 
clients
 
do
 
not
 
leave
 
me.
 
That's
 
what
 
I
 
have
 
in
 
Israel
 
right
 
now.
 
And
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
basically
 
clone
 
that
 
to
 
the
 
U.S.
 
just
 
in
 
way
 
higher
 
ticket
 
with
 
a
 
better
 
purpose,
 
as
 
I
 
told
 
you
 
on
 
our
 
first
 
call.
 
So
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
I
 
hope
 
this,
 
does
 
this
 
answer
 
your
 
question?
 
 
@2:54
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
suppose
 
so.
 
You
 
said
 
so.
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
telling
 
you
 
where
 
I
 
am
 
in
 
general,
 
and
 
I
 
mentioned
 
this
 
briefly
 
yesterday,
 
that
 
there's
 
anxiety
 
around
 
me
 
leaving
 
this
 
company,
 
not
 
because
 
they're
 
good,
 
they're
 
terrible,
 
that
 
I
 
had
 
another
 
email
 
after
 
that,
 
and
 
it's
 
the
 
same
 
version
 
of
 
some
 
kind
 
of
 
email
 
every
 
time
 
that's
 
trying
 
to
 
just
 
calm
 
me
 
and
 
everybody
 
else
 
is
 
going
 
through
 
this.

So
 
wait,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
cut
 
you
 
for
 
a
 
second
 
here.
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
but
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
something
 
extremely
 
clear.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
marketing
 
agency
 
Oriel,
 
live
 
for
 
more,
 
this
 
is
 
Oriel,
 
Oriel,
 
okay?
 
What's
 
your
 
alternative
 
here?
 
 
@3:46
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah,
 
no,
 
the
 
alternative
 
is
 
that
 
I
 
find
 
another
 
agency
 
or
 
somebody
 
else
 
that
 
does
 
something,
 
that's
 
obviously
 
one
 
thing,
 
or
 
I
 
figure
 
out
 
that
 
they're
 
doing
 
something
 
wrong
 
and
 
that's
 
something
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
fix.
 
But-
 
It
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
like
 
that.
 
Nothing
 
else
 
has
 
happened.
 
So
 
no,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
great
 
alternative.
 
I
 
just
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
jump
 
from
 
the
 
frying
 
pan
 
into
 
the
 
fire
 
and
 
just
 
be
 
in
 
another
 
situation
 
where
 
I'm
 
not
 
doing
 
well.
 
I
 
guess
 
the
 
advantage
 
here
 
is
 
what
 
we're
 
talking
 
about
 
is
 
me
 
moving
 
into
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
accounts
 
and
 
then
 
not
 
having
 
to
 
and
 
having
 
my
 
own
 
access
 
to
 
my
 
own
 
data,
 
which
 
is
 
important.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
feel
 
stuck
 
as
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
reasons
 
what
 
I
 
imagine
 
this
 
is
 
by
 
design
 
is
 
that
 
I
 
feel
 
stuck
 
with
 
them
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
numbers.
 
I
 
got
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
all
 
the
 
verifications.
 
I
 
mean,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
like
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
good
 
news
 
as
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
main
 
numbers
 
or
 
our
 
main
 
numbers
 
are
 
owned
 
by
 
me
 
in
 
Colerail.
 
So
 
I
 
have
 
like
 
a
 
separate,
 
are
 
you
 
familiar
 
with
 
Colerail?
 
 
@4:49

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
but
 
I
 
just
 
know,
 
I
 
know
 
how
 
Lead
 
Connector
 
works.
 
The
 
thing
 
is
 
with
 
Lead
 
Connector,
 
there's,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you
 
in
 
the
 
email,
 
there's
 
Twilio,
 
if
 
you're
 
familiar
 
with
 
Twilio
 
and
 
then
 
there's
 
Lead
 
Connector.
 
And
 
the
 
past
 
year,
 
go
 
ahead.
 
High
 
level
 
has
 
made
 
a
 
change
 
in
 
which
 
all
 
numbers
 
are
 
under
 
lead
 
connector.
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
why
 
they
 
did
 
that.
 
Obviously,
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
because
 
of
 
retention,
 
but
 
yeah,
 
there's
 
like,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
that
 
there's
 
like
 
very
 
separates
 
and
 
separate
 
entities
 
for
 
your
 
business.
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
entity
 
is
 
the
 
right
 
word,
 
but
 
there's
 
different
 
assets
 
for
 
your
 
business.
 
There's
 
the
 
assets
 
that
 
they
 
build
 
for
 
the
 
funnel
 
itself.
 
That's
 
on-go
 
high
 
level,
 
as
 
I
 
told
 
you.
 
And
 
then
 
there's
 
your
 
assets,
 
your
 
website,
 
the
 
reu.life,
 
that's
 
yours.
 
And
 
then
 
there's
 
the
 
funnel,
 
which
 
is
 
r.reu.life,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
funnel,
 
like
 
a
 
subdomain
 
on-go
 
high
 
level,
 
and
 
that's
 
theirs.
 
And
 
honestly,
 
I
 
don't
 
care.
 
 
@5:39

Michael
 
Their
 
funnel
 
isn't
 
even
 
that
 
good
 
in
 
any
 
ways.
 
when
 
you
 
say
 
their
 
funnel,
 
what

A

me
 
show

Yeah,

a
 
bit
 
complicated.
 
No,
 
so
 
let
 
me,
 
and
 
I'm
 
about
 
the
 
computer,
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
it
 
sucks,

we

everything,

we
 
have
 
seen
 
that
 
they
 
uploaded
 
a

I'm

it's
 
because
 
of
 
your

Michael
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
can
 
find
 
another

so
 
I
 
can

more
 
clearly
 
on

Let
 
me

if
 
I

this.
 
Okay.

Awesome.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
funnel.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
funnel
 
that
 
they
 
use.
 
This
 
is
 
on-go
 
high
 
level.
 
They
 
built
 
this
 
on-go
 
high
 
level.
 
And
 
you
 
have
 
basically
 
this,
 
this
 
page.
 
This
 
is
 
m.ru.life.
 
Sorry.
 
Go
 
ahead.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
this,
 
m.reu.life,
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
here
 
in
 
the
 
thing.
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
website,
 
that's
 
the
 
funnel
 
on
 
Go
 
High
 
Level.
 
Building
 
this
 
is
 
extremely
 
simple,
 
it
 
can
 
take
 
me
 
exactly
 
an
 
hour.
 
And
 
I
 
don't
 
even
 
want
 
to
 
build
 
it
 
like
 
that,
 
it's
 
that
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
good,
 
honestly.
 
And
 
then
 
there's
 
reu.life,
 
which
 
is
 
your
 
website.
 
That's
 
your
 
website.
 
That's
 
your
 
core
 
website,
 
they
 
cannot
 
touch
 
that.
 
They
 
cannot
 
touch
 
that,
 
that's
 
illegal
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
touch
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
did
 
they
 
create
 
this
 
website
 
for
 
you?
 
Yes.
 
All
 
right,
 
it's
 
still
 
your
 
website,
 
you
 
paid
 
for
 
that,
 
right?
 
How
 
much
 
money
 
did
 
you
 
pay
 
for
 
I
 
pay
 
for
 
it,
 
it's
 
like
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
month,
 
that's
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
service.
 
Your
 
domain
 
is
 
part
 
no,
 
the
 
domain
 
is
 
mine,
 
I
 
bought
 
the
 
domain,
 
I
 
own
 
the
 
domain.
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
recently
 
gave
 
them
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
domain,
 
I
 
can
 
always
 
pull
 
their
 
access.
 
To
 
the
 
domain,
 
they
 
wanted
 
to
 
make
 
some
 
changes
 
or
 
whatever,
 
but
 
I
 
can
 
always
 
pull
 
out
 
their
 
access.
 
Is
 
that
 
on
 
WordPress,
 
by
 
any
 
chance?
 
Sorry?
 
No,
 
no,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
it's
 
on
 
WordPress,
 
like,
 
where
 
the
 
website
 
is
 
built
 
on,
 
like,
 
what's
 
the
 
platform?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
idea
 
what
 
platform
 
it's
 
built
 
on?
 
Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's
 
a
 
couple
 
of,
 
like,
 
platforms
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
build
 
websites
 
on?
 
You
 
what
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about?
 
Oh,
 
you're
 
stuck.

Okay.
 
It's
 
all
 
good.
 
So
 
the
 
platform
 
is,
 
like,
 
you
 
can
 
build
 
websites
 
on
 
different
 
platforms.
 
One
 
of
 
them
 
is
 
WordPress.
 
That's
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
famous
 
ones.

You

you

I
 
can
 
look
 
up
 
where
 
they
 
built
 
that

also
 
they
 
cannot,
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
pull
 
their
 
access,
 
and
 
also
 
it's
 
illegal
 
for
 
them

take
 
it
 
down,
 
it's
 
your

your

it's
 
your

so
 
that's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
made

also

they

I

I
 
don't,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
look,
 
have
 
to
 
find,
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
I
 
have
 
from
 
them
 
for
 
some
 
reason
 
is
 
a

I
 
have

find
 
the
 
signed
 
agreement
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
with
 
them,
 
and
 
we
 
signed
 
up,
 
I'll
 
have
 
to
 
look
 
around
 
for
 
it,
 
but
 
to
 
my
 
recollection,
 
the
 
website
 
is
 
ours,
 
the
 
question
 
is,
 
I
 
mean,
 
they
 
have
 
the
 
phone
 
numbers
 
on
 
there
 
are
 
actually
 
call
 
rail
 
numbers,
 
not
 
theirs,
 
it's
 
forwarding,
 
the
 
call
 
rail
 
numbers
 
are
 
forwarding,
 
So
 
that's
 
fine.
 
Yeah,
 
those
 
numbers.
 
Yeah,
 
those
 
numbers.
 
There
 
numbers
 
I
 
own
 
in
 
CallRail,
 
although
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
them
 
because
 
the
 
area
 
code
 
is
 
not
 
something
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
have,
 
but
 
I'm
 
leaving
 
that
 
one
 
off
 
because
 
it's
 
not
 
working.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
the
 
phone
 
numbers
 
are
 
mine
 
from
 
CallRail.
 
Eventually
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
change
 
them
 
because
 
we're
 
in
 
a
 
732
 
area
 
code.
 
feel
 
like
 
people
 
see
 
908,
 
they
 
think
 
that
 
it's
 
in
 
southern
 
New
 
Jersey
 
and
 
not
 
central
 
New
 
Jersey.
 
So
 
that's
 
something
 
to
 
change.
 
I'm
 
sure,
 
CallRail,
 
you're
 
familiar.
 
It's
 
a
 
phone
 
tracking
 
software.
 
I'd
 
love
 
to
 
not
 
have
 
it.
 
The
 
reason
 
why
 
I'm
 
paying
 
$200
 
a
 
month
 
for
 
it
 
is
 
ATP

When
 
they
 
did
 
it,
 
when
 
Ketamine
 
Media
 
did
 
it,
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
month
 
of
 
absolute
 
hell.
 
Months?
 
was
 
a
 
month,
 
a
 
month
 
of,
 
the
 
main
 
number
 
was
 
we
 
had
 
to
 
send...
 
Everybody
 
messages,
 
this
 
is
 
our
 
number,
 
but
 
it's
 
only
 
for
 
now,
 
and
 
then
 
when
 
we
 
sent
 
it
 
back,
 
we
 
switched
 
it
 
again,
 
and
 
we
 
lost
 
patients.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
disaster.
 
And
 
it
 
cost,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
$10,000,
 
$15,000
 
in
 
patient
 
volume,
 
just
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
money.
 
it's
 
just
 
like
 
every
 
time
 
I
 
think
 
about
 
doing
 
it,
 
it's
 
always
 
like,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
can't
 
get
 
into
 
this.

And
 
yeah,
 
anyway,
 
so,
 
so
 
yeah,
 
that's,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
solution,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
do
 
it
 
like
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
but
 
I'm
 
not,
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
right,
 
you've,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
like
 
how
 
much,
 
here's,
 
here's
 
what's
 
gonna,
 
here's
 
what's
 
gonna
 
happen.

I
 
imagine
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
conversation
 
with
 
this,
 
there's
 
a
 
couple
 
ways,
 
you
 
know,
 
assuming
 
I
 
make
 
a
 
change,
 
if
 
I
 
have,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
probably
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
change
 
no
 
matter
 
what,
 
you
 
know,
 
because
 
I
 
just
 
don't,
 
I
 
mean,
 
can
 
you
 
tell
 
me,
 
is,
 
is
 
it
 
a
 
thing,
 
I
 
mean,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
make
 
sense
 
to
 
me,
 
as
 
a
 
business
 
owner,
 
that
 
Facebook,
 
when
 
I
 
give
 
them,
 
say,
 
okay,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
up
 
my,
 
Adspend,
 
that
 
they
 
say,
 
okay,
 
you
 
can't
 
get
 
any
 
leads
 
for
 
two
 
weeks
 
when
 
you
 
increase
 
your
 
money.

Nobody's
 
going
 
to
 
want
 
to
 
increase
 
their
 
money.
 
,
 
man.
 
As
 
I've
 
told
 
you
 
in
 
the
 
message,
 
.
 
I've
 
showed
 
you
 
the
 
campaign
 
itself.
 
And,
 
man,
 
I'm
 
doing
 
changes
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis.
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you.
 
Like,
 
I've
 
done
 
this.
 
I
 
was
 
not
 
–
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
believe
 
me
 
or
 
not,
 
but
 
I
 
am
 
–
 
I'm
 
like
 
–
 
I'm
 
in
 
this
 
deep,
 
okay?
 
I
 
know
 
everything
 
works.
 
And
 
I
 
know
 
every
 
,
 
every
 
excuse.
 
I
 
know
 
every
 
tactic.
 
And
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
being
 
used
 
to
 
mislead
 
you
 
to
 
thinking,
 
oh,
 
wow,
 
that
 
actually
 
makes
 
sense.
 
That
 
if
 
you
 
ramp
 
up,
 
it
 
disrupts
 
the
 
algorithm
 
because
 
it
 
shocks
 
it,
 
and
 
now
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
readjust.
 
all
 
that
 
.
 
 
@12:45
 
-
 
Michael
 
Like,
 
I'm
 
sorry
 
for
 
the
 
word,
 
but
 
–
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
right.
 
 
@12:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
mean,
 
just
 
–
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
stop,
 
okay?
 
As
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
everything
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
creative
 
and
 
funnel.
 
These
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
things.
 
But,
 
like,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
–
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
thing,
 
like,
 
a
 
belief
 
that
 
you
 
To
 
engrave
 
in
 
your
 
brain.
 
Creative
 
and
 
funnel.
 
If
 
anyone
 
in
 
the
 
future,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
if
 
you
 
work
 
with
 
me,
 
somebody
 
else,
 
if
 
anybody
 
tries
 
to
 
sell
 
you
 
on
 
algorithm
 
,
 
you
 
know
 
it's
 
.
 
 
@13:16
 
-
 
Michael
 
Okay.
 
What
 
happens
 
when
 
they,
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
switchover,
 
what
 
does
 
that
 
switchover
 
look
 
like?
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
sent
 
me
 
something
 
on
 
this
 
yesterday,
 
but
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
it
 
better.
 
Um,
 
if
 
let's
 
say
 
I,
 
I
 
say,
 
okay,
 
let's,
 
let's
 
go
 
ahead
 
with
 
this
 
is
 
obviously
 
I
 
have
 
some,
 
some,
 
uh,
 
price
 
concerns,
 
questions
 
around
 
that.
 
Um,
 
which
 
has
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
the
 
performance
 
side
 
and
 
the,
 
and
 
the,
 
and
 
the,
 
uh,
 
monthly
 
retainer.
 
Um,
 
and,
 
and,
 
and
 
honestly,
 
I'm,
 
looking
 
for
 
this
 
contract
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
with
 
them
 
just
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
breakdown
 
of
 
what
 
I'm
 
paying
 
for
 
what.
 
Um,
 
but
 
meaning
 
like
 
how
 
much
 
money
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
add.
 
Um,
 
And
 
how
 
much
 
money
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
SEO,
 
and
 
how
 
much
 
money
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
retail,
 
can
 
you
 
tell
 
me,
 
just
 
by
 
looking
 
at
 
it,
 
how
 
much
 
they
 
actually
 
spent
 
on
 
ads?
 
 
@14:06
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
SEO,
 
there's
 
no
 
money
 
going
 
to
 
SEO,
 
that's
 
organic,
 
first
 
of
 
all.
 
Yeah,
 
but
 
part
 
of
 
what
 
I'm
 
paying
 
them
 
monthly
 
that's
 
going
 
towards
 
SEO,
 
which
 
really
 
means
 
they're
 
generating
 
a
 
couple
 
blog
 
posts.
 
Yeah,
 
I've
 
been
 
seeing,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
give
 
them
 
credit
 
for.
 
They
 
probably
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
SEO
 
guy,
 
maybe
 
he
 
cares
 
about
 
his
 
job.
 
They
 
publish,
 
like,
 
three
 
to
 
two
 
blog
 
posts
 
every
 
two
 
months,
 
approximately,
 
it
 
seems
 
like.
 
And
 
it
 
puts
 
you
 
on
 
the
 
top
 
three.
 
When
 
you
 
search
 
for
 
ketamine
 
therapy
 
in
 
New
 
Jersey,
 
it
 
puts
 
you
 
on
 
the
 
top
 
three
 
in
 
Google.
 
Question
 
is,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you
 
yesterday,
 
how
 
many
 
patients
 
do
 
you
 
get
 
organically?
 
Is
 
it
 
like
 
a
 
searchable
 
thing?
 
 
@14:49
 
-
 
Michael
 
You
 
know,
 
I'll
 
answer
 
that
 
question
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
organic
 
patients
 
that
 
I
 
get
 
are
 
probably
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
best
 
leads.
 
 
@14:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@14:56
 
-
 
Michael
 
You
 
know,
 
those
 
are
 
the
 
best
 
leads.
 
They're
 
always
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
best
 
leads.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
the
 
highest
 
quality
 
leads
 
that
 
I
 
get,
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
come
 
from
 
Google
 
My
 
Business,
 
which
 
is
 
probably
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
people
 
are
 
searching
 
for
 
KetaminearMe
 
or
 
Ryu,
 
those
 
are
 
the
 
most
 
solid
 
leads
 
that
 
I
 
get.
 
It's
 
also
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
competition
 
in
 
my
 
immediate
 
area,
 
so
 
that's
 
part
 
of
 
it.
 
But
 
basically
 
SEO,
 
I'm
 
kind
 
of
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
on
 
my
 
own
 
after
 
that.
 
 
@15:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
right.
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
work.
 
I'm
 
building
 
my
 
stuff,
 
you
 
know.
 
And
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
hire
 
somebody
 
that
 
can
 
actually
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
it
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@15:32
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
mess
 
with
 
SEO.
 
I've
 
never
 
liked
 
SEO.
 
 
@15:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
just
 
hate
 
doing
 
that.
 
If
 
I
 
can
 
find
 
a
 
workaround
 
with
 
AI,
 
I
 
will
 
do
 
that
 
because
 
that's
 
probably
 
what
 
they
 
do.
 
 
@15:43
 
-
 
Michael
 
Correct
 
me
 
if
 
I'm
 
wrong.
 
Did
 
they
 
tell
 
you
 
that?
 
do,
 
but
 
they
 
like,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
phone
 
conversations.
 
They're
 
doing
 
some
 
white
 
hat
 
things
 
and
 
some
 
whatever
 
that
 
they
 
don't,
 
whatever
 
it
 
is,
 
it's
 
more
 
lip
 
service.
 
 
@15:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
The
 
answer
 
is
 
it's
 
another
 
black
 
box
 
for
 
me.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
 
@15:58
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
I
 
think
 
I'd
 
understand
 
it.
 
I
 
think
 
they
 
deliberately
 
don't
 
share
 
the
 
right
 
amount
 
of
 
information.
 
I'll
 
tell
 
you,
 
the
 
other
 
people
 
who
 
have
 
told
 
me
 
about
 
doing
 
this
 
is
 
like,
 
the
 
best
 
thing
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
do
 
it
 
in-house,
 
which
 
is
 
honestly
 
not
 
realistic
 
for
 
me.
 
I
 
just
 
don't
 
have
 
the
 
personnel
 
or
 
my
 
personal
 
know-how.
 
I'm
 
smart.
 
I
 
can
 
learn
 
stuff,
 
but
 
it
 
takes
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
time,
 
and
 
I
 
can't
 
unwind
 
my
 
business
 
while
 
I
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
digital
 
advertising.
 
If
 
I'm
 
doing
 
it
 
with
 
somebody
 
who
 
explains
 
it
 
clearly
 
and
 
doesn't
 
feed
 
me
 
,
 
and
 
I
 
understand
 
a
 
clear
 
KPI
 
list,
 
and
 
I
 
understand
 
that
 
the
 
nod
 
of
 
turn,
 
I'm
 
creative,
 
I
 
can
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
good
 
ways
 
to
 
get
 
things
 
done.
 
But
 
right
 
now,
 
this
 
component
 
is
 
not
 
really,
 
that
 
part's
 
not
 
working.
 
But
 
what
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
ascertain,
 
before
 
I
 
make
 
any
 
switches,
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
switch
 
ACTION
 
ITEM:
 
Contact
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
request
 
login
 
details
 
for
 
WordPress
 
site
 
-
 
WATCH
 
Which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
somewhat
 
seamless.
 
So
 
you're
 
saying
 
that
 
the
 
website,
 
I
 
go
 
online,
 
I
 
lock
 
them
 
out
 
from
 
it.
 
Right
 
now,
 
even
 
if
 
they're
 
not
 
on
 
there,
 
if
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
changes,
 
they're
 
making
 
changes
 
to
 
the
 
website.
 
 
@17:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
they
 
do
 
have
 
access.
 
 
@17:13
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
undo
 
that
 
access.
 
 
@17:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it
 
depends
 
on
 
what
 
–
 
let
 
me
 
check
 
this
 
first.
 
 
@17:21
 
-
 
Michael
 
Probably
 
through
 
WordPress.
 
 
@17:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
searched
 
it
 
up.
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
it's
 
through
 
WordPress.
 
So
 
let
 
me
 
–
 
I
 
used
 
something
 
called
 
Portal,
 
I
 
think,
 
to
 
–
 
Well,
 
let
 
–
 
–
 
That
 
doesn't
 
help
 
me
 
with
 
anything.
 
If
 
you're
 
interested
 
in
 
that
 
Fentanyl
 
built
 
with
 
or
 
Wappalizer.
 
Yeah.
 
Um,
 
 
@18:03
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
most
 
simple
 
way
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
cooperate,
 
the
 
clearest
 
way
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
cooperate,
 
is
 
basically,
 
I
 
tell
 
them
 
that
 
I
 
hired
 
somebody
 
who's
 
doing
 
it
 
in-house.
 
 
@18:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
it
 
is
 
WordPress.
 
 
@18:23
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah.
 
 
@18:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
interesting
 
because
 
usually
 
when
 
you
 
go
 
to
 
WordPress
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
this
 
little
 
hack
 
that
 
I
 
use
 
and
 
you
 
do
 
WP
 
slash
 
admin,
 
you're
 
supposed
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
login.
 
Right.
 
That's
 
weird.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
understand
 
where
 
it's
 
built
 
on
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
you
 
can
 
lock
 
them
 
out
 
of
 
it.
 
Like
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
ask
 
like,
 
what's
 
my
 
details?
 
How
 
can
 
I
 
log
 
in?
 
Like
 
all
 
that.
 
Did
 
they
 
provide
 
you
 
with
 
these
 
things?
 
Yeah.
 
For
 
the
 
login
 
details
 
and
 
everything?
 
And
 
the
 
link

I
 
don't
 
think
 
so.
 
 
@19:05
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
don't
 
remember
 
it.
 
 
@19:07

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
they
 
have
 
to
 
give
 
it
 
to
 
you.
 
Like,
 
what?
 
This
 
doesn't
 
make
 
any
 
sense.
 
Like,
 
it's
 
not,
 
it's
 
just...
 
 
@19:14

Michael
 
It's
 
just
 
frustrating,
 
honestly.
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
question
 
is,
 
is
 
there's
 
a
 
way
 
I
 
can...
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
ways
 
is
 
that
 
I
 
tell
 
them,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'm
 
making
 
a
 
new
 
decision.
 
I
 
mean,
 
he's
 
obviously
 
sensitive
 
around
 
other
 
companies,
 
because
 
they
 
said
 
when
 
I
 
saw
 
his
 
reaction
 
last
 
time,
 
when
 
I
 
had
 
somebody
 
else
 
poking
 
around.
 
But
 
if
 
I
 
told
 
them
 
that
 
I'm
 
hiring
 
somebody
 
in-house
 
to
 
work
 
for
 
the
 
company
 
who's
 
going
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
marketing
 
and
 
knows
 
digital
 
advertising,
 
what's
 
he
 
going
 
to
 
say?
 
You
 
know,
 
like,
 
I'm
 
just,
 
I
 
decided
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
marketing
 
in-house.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
easier
 
pill
 
for
 
him
 
to
 
swallow.
 
Whoa.
 
Well,
 
I
 
mean,
 
he's
 
not
 
making
 
that
 
much
 
money
 
off
 
me.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
He
 
just
 
maybe
 
his
 
business
 
isn't
 
doing
 
that
 
great.
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure.
 
But
 
he
 
was
 
very,
 
very
 
sensitive
 
and
 
kind
 
of
 
blew
 
up.
 
Afterwards,
 
he
 
chilled
 
out.
 
But
 
and
 
and
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
conversation
 
with
 
him
 
about
 
not
 
having
 
this
 
issue
 
come
 
up
 
again.
 
But
 
it
 
did
 
happen
 
at
 
the
 
time.
 
So
 
so
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
that's
 
his
 
concern.
 
Let
 
me
 
table
 
that
 
for
 
a
 
minute
 
here.
 
We'll
 
table
 
out
 
the
 
strategy
 
around
 
switching.
 
What
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
avoid
 
is
 
the
 
least
 
possible
 
headaches
 
in
 
this
 
happening.
 
 
@20:31

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Right.
 
 
@20:32
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
you're
 
saying
 
that
 
for
 
you,
 
A2P
 
takes
 
a
 
week.
 
 
@20:36
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
if
 
it's
 
done
 
right.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do.
 
 
@20:39
 
-
 
Michael
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
right.
 
So
 
what
 
about
 
contacts
 
within?
 
So
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
they're
 
claiming,
 
although
 
it
 
hasn't
 
shown
 
that
 
it's
 
been
 
that
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
like
 
some
 
more
 
dedicated
 
people
 
to
 
work
 
with,
 
although
 
I
 
think
 
they
 
actually
 
all
 
Israel
 
to
 
work
 
on,
 
like
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
at
 
Facebook,
 
they
 
have
 
somebody
 
to
 
talk
 
to.
 
 
@21:00

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
the
 
problem
 
with
 
Facebook
 
is
 
if
 
they,
 
I
 
understand
 
what
 
they're
 
talking
 
about.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
dedicated
 
account
 
manager,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
that
 
because
 
there's
 
two
 
levels
 
of
 
that.
 
Okay.
 
There's
 
a
 
level
 
of
 
which
 
you're
 
a
 
big
 
company
 
and
 
then
 
there's
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
Facebook
 
support
 
is
 
good.
 
And
 
then
 
there's
 
Facebook
 
support.
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
good
 
Facebook
 
support
 
right
 
now.
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
like,
 
there's
 
the
 
guy,
 
Julius.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
dedicated
 
account
 
manager
 
that's
 
like
 
on
 
A
 
very
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
Facebook.
 
 
@21:32
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah,
 
Julius.
 
 
@21:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Because
 
they
 
are
 
spending
 
like
 
$500,000
 
a
 
month
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
that
 
level
 
of
 
support.
 
I
 
cannot
 
tell
 
you.
 
I
 
cannot
 
verify
 
that
 
to
 
you.
 
 
@21:44
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to.
 
they're
 
thinking
 
of
 
making
 
a
 
jump,
 
Julius?
 
What
 
are
 
you
 
saying?
 
Julius,
 
I
 
imagine
 
has
 
another,
 
it
 
has
 
a
 
firm
 
working
 
for
 
them
 
or
 
they
 
do
 
it
 
in
 
house.
 
 
@21:52
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
know.
 
Julius
 
has
 
like
 
four
 
marketing
 
people
 
inside
 
there
 
and
 
they
 
want
 
me
 
basically
 
for
 
the,
 
for
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
the
 
creative.
 
imagine
 
there's
 
all
 
Thank
 
you.
 
And
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
writing
 
for
 
them,
 
too.
 
Got
 
it.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
They're
 
doing
 
insane
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
bypassing
 
Facebook
 
systems
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
And
 
doing
 
that
 
is
 
fine,
 
because
 
they're
 
spending
 
so
 
much
 
money,
 
nobody
 
cares.
 
Right.
 
 
@22:19
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
mean,
 
that's
 
obviously
 
a
 
big
 
component
 
for
 
them.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
my
 
question
 
is
 
some
 
questions
 
around
 
the
 
well-thought-out
 
transition
 
is
 
that
 
I
 
understand
 
how
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
work.
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
what
 
you
 
sent
 
me,
 
I
 
got
 
it.
 
I
 
mean,
 
whatever
 
the
 
–
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
it
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
me,
 
what
 
you
 
sent
 
me.
 
 
@22:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
sent
 
it
 
over
 
email.
 
Hang
 
on,
 
I
 
got
 
the
 
link
 
here.
 
The
 
questions
 
that
 
you
 
had?
 
 
@22:49
 
-
 
Michael
 
Or
 
email?
 
No.
 
Well,
 
I
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
back.
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
think.
 
Now,
 
you
 
mentioned
 
about
 
having,
 
let's
 
say,
 
$29
 
per
 
conversion
 
as
 
a
 
fee.
 
 
@22:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
then
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
–
 
Yeah,
 
but
 
the
 
conversion,
 
the
 
deposit
 
fee
 
is
 
not
 
paid
 
by
 
you,
 
it's
 
paid
 
by
 
the
 
patient.
 
Correct.
 
Yeah,
 
then
 
the
 
deposit
 
on
 
the
 
patient.
 
 
@23:10
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
$30
 
less
 
than
 
I'm
 
getting.
 
 
@23:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
also
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
thought
 
of,
 
because
 
I've
 
had
 
this
 
conversation
 
with
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
couple
 
of
 
days,
 
I
 
have
 
an
 
even
 
crazier
 
offer
 
for
 
you,
 
okay?
 
Month
 
two,
 
okay,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
KPI
 
to
 
hit,
 
okay?
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
month,
 
if
 
you're
 
not
 
happy
 
with
 
the
 
results,
 
you're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
me
 
until
 
you
 
are.
 
What
 
does
 
that
 
mean?
 
Like,
 
there's
 
a
 
retainer
 
month,
 
if
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
month
 
two,
 
you're
 
not
 
happy
 
with
 
the
 
results,
 
you're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
me
 
a
 
retainer
 
the
 
next
 
month.
 
You're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
pay
 
me
 
until
 
we
 
hit
 
the
 
results
 
and
 
you're
 
happy.
 
Obviously,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
find
 
the
 
spot
 
in
 
which
 
like,
 
okay,
 
this
 
is
 
good,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
want.
 
 
@23:50
 
-
 
Michael
 
Right.
 
 
@23:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And,
 
yeah.
 
 
@23:51
 
-
 
Michael
 
Well,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
want
 
to,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
have
 
data
 
as
 
to
 
like,
 
how
 
many
 
new
 
patients
 
I
 
had
 
of
 
a
 
specific
 
I
 
know
 
how
 
many
 
ketamine
 
patients
 
I
 
had
 
each
 
month
 
from
 
what
 
we
 
new
 
ketamine
 
patients.
 
So
 
if
 
it's
 
more
 
than
 
that,
 
or
 
whatever
 
number
 
we
 
come
 
up
 
with,
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
that,
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that.
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
I'm
 
not
 
doing
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
where
 
I'm
 
just
 
throwing
 
money
 
every
 
month
 
and
 
just
 
praying,
 
usually
 
without
 
unanswered
 
prayers.
 
 
@24:24

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Let
 
me,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
I
 
understand
 
your
 
concerns
 
on
 
a
 
very
 
high
 
level.
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
sense
 
on
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
you
 
talk,
 
you
 
are
 
extremely
 
nervous.
 
And
 
that's
 
completely
 
fine,
 
I
 
understand
 
that.
 
Because
 
when
 
you
 
go
 
through
 
such,
 
that's
 
basically
 
like,
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
call
 
it
 
trauma,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
trauma.
 
 
@24:42
 
-
 
Michael
 
No,
 
no,
 
it's
 
been
 
a
 
terrible...
 
 
@24:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
understand
 
when
 
you
 
go
 
through
 
something
 
like
 
that,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
cautious
 
with
 
every
 
single
 
step
 
that
 
you
 
take.
 
 
@24:52
 
-
 
Michael
 
Because
 
it's
 
not
 
like,
 
it
 
kind
 
of
 
reminds
 
me
 
of
 
me
 
being
 
in
 
the
 
army
 
because
 
I
 
was
 
in
 
the
 
IVF.
 
 
@24:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
there's
 
a
 
situation
 
which
 
you
 
feel
 
like
 
you
 
are...
 
We
 
there,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
like
 
it's
 
a
 
job,
 
like
 
you
 
can
 
walk
 
up
 
and
 
leave.
 
No,
 
they're
 
holding
 
you
 
by
 
the
 
balls.
 
 
@25:06
 
-
 
Michael
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
things
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
out
 
of
 
there.
 
 
@25:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
when
 
you
 
get
 
out
 
of
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
system,
 
you
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
back
 
there
 
ever
 
again.
 
You
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
experience
 
anything
 
like
 
that
 
ever
 
again.
 
So
 
I
 
understand
 
where
 
you're
 
coming
 
from.
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
that,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
communication
 
on
 
our
 
side,
 
because
 
I
 
see
 
that
 
they're
 
communicating
 
mostly
 
through
 
email,
 
we're
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
that.
 
There's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
Slack,
 
WhatsApp,
 
messages,
 
calls,
 
doesn't
 
matter.
 
You
 
have
 
it,
 
and
 
it's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
change.
 
It's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
change.
 
I'm
 
telling
 
you
 
right
 
here,
 
right
 
now.
 
 
@25:33
 
-
 
Michael
 
Okay.
 
 
@25:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
also
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
your
 
data,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
wanted
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
agreement,
 
but
 
your
 
data
 
is
 
your
 
data.
 
I
 
am
 
a,
 
I'm
 
an
 
ethical
 
businessman.
 
I
 
say,
 
you
 
could
 
say,
 
I'm
 
not,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
leave.
 
 
@25:49
 
-
 
Michael
 
Okay.
 
 
@25:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I've
 
had,
 
I
 
had
 
so
 
many
 
clients
 
and
 
so
 
many
 
people
 
left
 
me.
 
I'm
 
basically
 
numb
 
at
 
this
 
point
 
for
 
that.
 
I'm
 
making
 
enough
 
money
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
not
 
get
 
throttled
 
and
 
go,
 
go
 
insane
 
by
 
a
 
client
 
leaving.
 
Okay.
 
So.
 
If
 
you
 
do
 
decide
 
to
 
leave,
 
you
 
have
 
your
 
data.
 
You
 
spent
 
money
 
for
 
that
 
data.
 
This
 
is
 
your
 
data.
 
Not
 
even
 
legally,
 
ethically.
 
That's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
I
 
work.
 
That's
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that.

Do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
contact
 
and
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
that
 
helps
 
you?

At
 
some
 
point,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
upgrade
 
to
 
their
 
premium
 
support.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
premium
 
support
 
for
 
$500.
 
I
 
don't
 
need
 
that
 
now
 
though.
 
 
@26:25
 
-
 
Michael
 
But
 
their
 
support
 
is
 
extremely
 
good.
 
Or
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
that
 
I
 
should
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
move
 
my
 
data
 
from
 
one
 
high
 
level
 
account
 
to
 
another.

That's
 
the
 
thing.
 
You
 
can
 
export
 
the
 
data.
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
synchronize
 
it
 
though.
 
That's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
check.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
it's,
 
again,
 
by
 
design
 
like
 
that.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
would
 
want
 
to
 
download
 
all
 
the
 
phones,
 
all
 
the
 
contacts
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
that.
 
And
 
also
 
have
 
the
 
snapshot
 
because
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
snapshot
 
like
 
a
 
template
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
take
 
that
 
snapshot
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
your
 
own,
 
can
 
just
 
paste
 
it
 
there
 
and
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
automations.
 
 
@26:59

Michael
 
All
 
the
 
My
 
automations
 
don't
 
exist.
 
have
 
to
 
build
 
those,
 
right?
 
Currently,
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
really
 
good
 
system.
 
We're
 
not
 
utilizing
 
emails
 
to
 
go
 
out
 
automatically.
 
We're
 
not
 
utilizing
 
some
 
automated
 
texts,
 
but
 
let's
 
say
 
not.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
best
 
practices.

I
 
imagine
 
that's
 
part
 
of
 
what
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
build,
 
right?
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
Yeah.
 
I'm
 
working
 
on
 
training
 
a
 
thing
 
called
 
CloseBot.
 
It's
 
an
 
AI
 
bot,
 
basically,
 
that
 
talks
 
like
 
a
 
human.
 
 
@27:31
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
that.
 
 
@27:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
I'm
 
training
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
use
 
that
 
too.
 
And
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
automation
 
set
 
up
 
for
 
people
 
that
 
from
 
the
 
moment
 
they
 
come
 
in
 
until
 
the
 
moment
 
that
 
they're
 
booked
 
and
 
even
 
after
 
the
 
consultation,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
automation
 
set
 
up.
 
There's,
 
you
 
know,
 
everything's
 
got,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
it
 
is
 
right
 
now
 
for
 
you,
 
but
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about
 
when
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
it.
 
Like,
 
it's
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
you're
 
just
 
have
 
to
 
see
 
with
 
your
 
own
 
eyes,
 
because
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
best
 
incentive.
 
time.
 
Bye.
 
Art
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
the
 
highest
 
quality
 
patients,
 
because
 
that's
 
what
 
I'm
 
getting
 
rewarded
 
for.
 
If
 
that
 
doesn't
 
happen,
 
I'm
 
in
 
a
 
problem.
 
So,
 
and
 
also
 
let's
 
not
 
talk
 
about
 
my
 
brand
 
name,
 
my
 
reputation,
 
and
 
you
 
refer
 
me
 
to
 
other
 
people,
 
because
 
I've
 
told
 
you
 
in
 
the
 
end,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
stop
 
with
 
the
 
ads
 
on
 
our
 
own
 
ads
 
for
 
like
 
three,
 
four
 
months,
 
get
 
some,
 
you
 
know,
 
attention,
 
film,
 
some
 
content,
 
and
 
then
 
create
 
a
 
flywheel
 
of
 
referrals
 
and
 
people
 
that
 
come
 
from
 
content
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
spend
 
money
 
on
 
ads.
 
That's
 
not
 
necessary.
 
 
@28:28

Michael
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
so,
 
excuse
 
me,
 
we're
 
both
 
coughing
 
and
 
sick,
 
so,
 
the,
 
just
 
take
 
me
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
transition,
 
what
 
that
 
would
 
look
 
like,
 
so,
 
we
 
have,
 
so,
 
it
 
didn't
 
sit,
 
like
 
I
 
didn't
 
get
 
such
 
a
 
clear
 
answer
 
from
 
you,
 
is
 
I
 
have
 
recorded
 
phone
 
calls
 
and
 
text
 
messages.
 
It's
 
from
 
patients
 
that,
 
that
 
we
 
often
 
.
 
More
 
importantly,
 
we
 
have
 
what
 
we
 
call
 
integration
 
notes.
 
So
 
we
 
keep
 
–
 
I
 
don't
 
love
 
that
 
it's
 
this
 
way,
 
but
 
because
 
my
 
EHR,
 
my
 
health
 
records
 
system
 
doesn't
 
talk
 
to
 
my
 
CRM,
 
which
 
is
 
go
 
high
 
level,
 
we
 
keep
 
integration
 
notes,
 
which
 
is
 
notes
 
about
 
the
 
patients,
 
how
 
they're
 
doing
 
in
 
each
 
session
 
from
 
the
 
–
 
we
 
like
 
have
 
guides,
 
like
 
psychedelic
 
guides,

they

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
and
 
understand
 
how
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
and
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
just
 
transition
 
all
 
the
 
notes.
 
The
 
notes,
 
the
 
phone
 
calls,
 
and
 
the
 
texts
 
because
 
that's
 
how
 
we
 
communicate
 
with
 
our
 
patients
 
and
 
recorded
 
calls.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
the
 
texts
 
themselves,
 
I
 
think
 
–
 
And
 
the
 
whole
 
conversation,
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
that
 
can
 
happen,
 
actually.
 
 
@30:07
 
-
 
Michael
 
And
 
the
 
reason
 
why
 
it's
 
important
 
is
 
something
 
we
 
can
 
refer
 
back
 
to.
 
It's
 
not
 
as
 
bad
 
if
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
for
 
a
 
while
 
into
 
another
 
system.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
archived
 
version,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
to
 
toggle
 
between
 
them
 
to
 
see
 
about
 
a
 
patient.
 
That's
 
okay.
 
But
 
I
 
don't
 
like
 
that
 
I'm
 
handcuffed
 
to
 
a
 
software
 
for
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
my
 
life.

Yeah,
 
it
 
wasn't
 
good
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
notes
 
on
 
go
 
high-level,
 
actually.
 
 
@30:36

never
 
had
 
this
 
situation,
 
actually,
 
before.
 
 
@30:47
 
-
 
Michael
 
We
 
have
 
notes
 
about
 
the
 
patient.
 
The
 
patient
 
doesn't
 
like
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
music.
 
We
 
have
 
different
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
patient
 
that
 
if
 
somebody
 
hasn't
 
come
 
in
 
in
 
a
 
year,
 
we
 
know,
 
oh,
 
this
 
person
 
doesn't,
 
you
 
know,
 
he's
 
an
 
orthodox
 
person.
 
doesn't
 
want
 
female.
 
We
 
have
 
that
 
in
 
the
 
notes.
 
That's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
important
 
question
 
to
 
know.
 
Not
 
everything
 
changed
 
over
 
last
 
time,

that's
 
something
 
that
 
I
 
would

to
 
see.

Maybe

find
 
out.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
them
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
that's
 
possible.
 
I've
 
never
 
had
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
thing
 
before,
 
and
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
them.
 
I
 
could
 
not
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
definitive
 
answer
 
for
 
that.
 
I'll
 
completely
 
honest.

The
 
good
 
news
 
is
 
the
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
haven't

to
 
me
 
is
 
the
 
one
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
hate
 
when
 
people
 
tell
 
me,
 
but
 
yet,
 
and
 
every
 
time
 
I
 
tell
 
it
 
to
 
me
 
and
 
I
 
kick
 
myself
 
for
 
working
 
with
 
that
 
person

what,
 
you

how

don't
 
give
 
you
 
too
 
many,
 
right?
 
 
@31:54
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
get
 
that
 
sometimes
 
and
 
I
 
always
 
know
 
it's
 
,
 
but
 
you
 
know,
 
in
 
this
 
case,
 
it's
 
just
 
so
 
much.
 
But
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
reverse
 
that
 
on
 
you.
 
How
 
quickly
 
can
 
we
 
ramp
 
up
 
the
 
patient
 
volume?
 
Will
 
I
 
see
 
a
 
lull
 
before
 
I
 
see
 
a
 
gain?
 
I
 
mean,
 
I'm
 
seeing
 
a
 
lull
 
right
 
now.
 
I
 
say
 
a
 
lull.
 
I've
 
received
 
a
 
single
 
lead
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
24
 
hours.
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
maybe
 
received
 
seven
 
leads
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
five
 
days,
 
of
 
which
 
since
 
80%
 
of
 
the
 
leads
 
are
 
,
 
don't
 
get
 
–
 
that's
 
no
 
patience.
 
I'm
 
basically
 
running
 
on
 
nothing.
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
–
 
I
 
have
 
older
 
patients.
 
have
 
patients
 
that
 
would
 
sign
 
up.
 
We
 
went
 
from
 
really
 
high
 
to
 
nothing.
 
And
 
this
 
happens
 
repeatedly.
 
Can
 
you
 
tell
 
me
 
why
 
that's
 
happening?
 
 
@32:45

it's

@32:46

Michael
 
It's
 
been
 
like
 
a
 
rollercoaster?
 
I
 
would
 
say
 
it's
 
like
 
up
 
and
 
down.
 
It's
 
like
 
–
 
it
 
goes
 
from
 
mediocre
 
good
 
to
 
zero.
 
And
 
it
 
just
 
happens
 
randomly.

I
 
think
 
the
 
greatest
 
thing
 
to
 
do
 
right
 
now
 
is
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
the
 
ads
 
like
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
that
 
would
 
make
 
it
 
so
 
much
 
better
 
for
 
you
 
and
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
exactly
 
why
 
the
 
ads
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
factor
 
here
 
and
 
what
 
actually
 
the
 
ad
 
creative
 
or
 
the
 
the
 
ad
 
the
 
ad
 
copy
 
yeah
 
creative
 
like
 
the
 
ad
 
creative
 
is
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
stops
 
the
 
scrolls.
 
but
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
most
 
is
 
the
 
ad
 
copy
 
itself
 
and
 
ad
 
copy
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
videos
 
so
 
that's
 
one
 
so
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
ads
 
here
 
that
 
are
 
wrote
 
okay
 
okay
 
and
 
they're
 
both
 
education
 
based
 
ads
 
and
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
read
 
it
 
to
 
you
 
then
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
explain
 
exactly
 
what
 
the
 
ad
 
does
 
so
 
education
 
based
 
that
 
one
 
okay
 
so
 
across
 
the
 
country
 
millions
 
of
 
people
 
are
 
currently
 
doing
 
everything
 
right
 
when
 
it

meds
 
didn't
 
help,
 
you
 
cannot
 
do
 
that.
 
not
 
illegal.
 
You
 
cannot
 
do
 
that
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
find
 
like
 
an
 
indirect
 
way
 
to
 
target
 
your
 
audience
 
without,
 
you
 
know,
 
calling
 
them
 
out.
 
So
 
across
 
the
 
country,
 
millions
 
of
 
people
 
are
 
trying
 
to
 
do
 
everything
 
right.
 
They're
 
showing
 
up
 
to
 
therapy,
 
taking
 
meds,
 
practicing
 
your
 
attitude,
 
trying
 
to
 
stay
 
positive.
 
But
 
still,
 
heaviness
 
stays
 
like
 
a
 
that
 
doesn't
 
lift.
 
The
 
conventional
 
system
 
tells
 
them
 
that
 
you
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
keep
 
going,
 
try
 
harder,
 
just
 
dose,
 
weigh
 
it
 
out.
 
Most
 
people
 
won't
 
get
 
it,
 
but
 
there's
 
something
 
uniquely
 
painful
 
about
 
doing
 
everything
 
that
 
you're
 
supposed
 
to
 
do,
 
but
 
still
 
not
 
get
 
better.
 
But
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
one
 
thing.
 
It's
 
not
 
that
 
you
 
didn't
 
try
 
hard
 
enough.
 
It's
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
gave
 
you
 
the
 
wrong
 
tools.
 
So
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing
 
here
 
right
 
now
 
is,
 
in
 
essence,
 
feeling
 
them,
 
okay?
 
I
 
am
 
describing
 
their
 
life
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
makes
 
them
 
feel
 
understood.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
remember
 
the
 
first
 
ad
 
that
 
I
 
wrote,
 
like
 
that
 
I
 
wrote
 
for
 
YouTube,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
details
 
for
 
me,
 
like
 
the
 
B2B
 
ad,
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
talking
 
about.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
as
 
we
 
know,
 
traditional
 
psychiatry
 
was
 
built
 
to
 
manage
 
symptoms,
 
not
 
resolve
 
them,
 
anxious,
 
add
 
a
 
meth,
 
cannot
 
sleep,
 
add
 
another,
 
still
 
stuck,
 
increase
 
the
 
dose,
 
but
 
let's
 
be
 
honest,
 
this
 
approach
 
is
 
like
 
turning
 
down
 
the
 
volume
 
on
 
a
 
smoke
 
alarm
 
while
 
your
 
house
 
is
 
still
 
on
 
fire,
 
doesn't
 
reset
 
the
 
system,
 
it
 
just
 
tries
 
to
 
mute
 
the
 
signal,
 
but
 
thanks
 
to
 
modern
 
science,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
like
 
that
 
anymore,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
where
 
we
 
build
 
the
 
hope
 
and
 
the
 
transition.
 
There's
 
a
 
new
 
path,
 
that's
 
designed
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
your
 
brain,
 
not
 
against
 
it,
 
doesn't
 
try
 
to
 
numb
 
what
 
you
 
feel,
 
it
 
helps
 
your
 
brain
 
reconnect,
 
recalibrate,
 
and
 
start
 
to
 
heal,
 
imagine
 
a
 
brain
 
like
 
a
 
snowy
 
heel,
 
every
 
thought,
 
emotion,
 
reaction,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
basically
 
explaining
 
how
 
depression
 
works,
 
but
 
again,
 
what
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
smoke
 
the
 
snow,
 
open
 
up
 
new
 
trails,
 
that
 
is
 
possible
 
thanks
 
to
 
ketamine-assisted
 
therapy,
 
psychotherapy,
 
and
 
you
 
explain
 
how
 
it
 
works,
 
and
 
you
 
explain
 
what
 
happens,
 
and
 
you
 
talk
 
about,
 
you
 
know,
 
what
 
happens
 
in
 
the
 
brain,
 
you
 
talk
 
about
 
studies,
 
and
 
you
 
about
 
know,
 
that
 
stuff,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
we
 
Because
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
who
 
you
 
are.
 
there's
 
no
 
you
 
in
 
the
 
picture,
 
when
 
you
 
talk
 
on
 
the
 
phone,
 
nobody
 
knows
 
who
 
the
 
they're
 
talking
 
about.
 
They
 
need
 
to
 
remember
 
somebody.
 
need
 
to
 
remember
 
a
 
character.
 
 
@36:12

Michael
 
Could
 
it
 
be
 
the
 
company
 
or
 
it
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
person?
 
 
@36:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
the
 
company
 
too.
 
But
 
if
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
name
 
itself,
 
it's
 
better
 
because
 
there's
 
a
 
person.
 
When
 
there's
 
a
 
person
 
behind
 
it,
 
it's
 
just
 
better.
 
Or
 
better.
 
So
 
I
 
work
 
with
 
patients
 
who
 
thought
 
they
 
tried
 
everything.
 
You
 
may
 
feel
 
the
 
same
 
way,
 
but
 
I
 
promise
 
you
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
different.
 
If
 
this
 
speaks
 
to
 
you,
 
created
 
something
 
just
 
for
 
you.
 
It's
 
called
 
the
 
mental
 
breakthrough
 
consultation.
 
And
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
doing
 
here
 
is
 
framing
 
it
 
as
 
like
 
telling
 
them
 
there's
 
an
 
offer
 
here.
 
Okay.
 
It's
 
not
 
just
 
vague.
 
There's
 
FDA
 
approved
 
ketamine
 
treatment.

Leave
 
your
 
details

@36:45

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
none
 
of
 
that
 
.
 
I'm
 
explaining
 
exactly
 
what
 
it
 
is.
 
It's
 
a
 
one-on-one
 
call
 
with
 
a
 
licensed
 
provider
 
to
 
explore
 
whether
 
this
 
path
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
finally
 
feel
 
like
 
yourself
 
again.
 
No
 
pressure,
 
no
 
judgment.
 
Just
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
explore
 
if
 
this
 
can
 
actually
 
work
 
for
 
you.
 
We're
 
covering
 
most
 
of
 
this.
 
So
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing
 
here
 
is
 
having
 
a
 
price
 
anchor.
 
can
 
also
 
change
 
that.
 
This
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
suggestion.
 
So
 
what
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
here
 
is
 
say
 
that
 
the
 
consultation
 
is
 
usually
 
$295.
 
We
 
sell
 
it
 
for
 
$95.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
consultation
 
and
 
you
 
also
 
book
 
them
 
and
 
get
 
them
 
committed.
 
We're
 
covering
 
most
 
of
 
this
 
consult
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
take
 
the
 
first
 
step
 
without
 
financial
 
pressure.
 
Instead
 
of
 
$295,
 
you
 
only
 
pay
 
$95.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
give
 
them
 
clarity
 
as
 
well.
 
By
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
this
 
call,
 
you
 
will
 
know,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
add
 
that
 
to.
 
 
@37:33
 
-
 
Michael
 
Pull
 
one,
 
pull
 
two,
 
if
 
you
 
made
 
it
 
here,
 
this
 
is
 
for
 
you.
 
 
@37:36

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Let's
 
take
 
the
 
first
 
step
 
together
 
and
 
then
 
they
 
click
 
on
 
the
 
link,
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
website
 
and
 
do
 
the
 
steps
 
there.
 
So
 
that's
 
ad
 
number
 
one.
 
Then
 
we
 
have
 
ad
 
number
 
two,
 
which
 
is
 
talking
 
from
 
a
 
different
 
angle.
 
It's
 
the
 
same
 
thing,
 
but
 
from
 
a
 
little
 
different
 
angle.
 
It's
 
a
 
different
 
hook.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
different
 
images.
 
And
 
it's
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
on
 
video
 
too.
 
Something
 
strange
 
happens
 
when
 
the
 
person,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
label
 
what
 
it
 
feels
 
like.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
talk
 
about
 
what
 
they
 
tried.
 
Here
 
I
 
put
 
a
 
stat
 
as
 
well.
 
That
 
is
 
true,
 
but
 
it's
 
insane.
 
Only
 
one
 
in
 
three
 
people
 
fully
 
recover
 
after
 
their
 
first
 
antidepressant.
 
And
 
even
 
after
 
multiple
 
rounds,
 
nearly
 
half
 
don't
 
find
 
relief,
 
which
 
is
 
insane.
 
Basically,
 
you
 
make
 
it
 
us
 
versus
 
the
 
system.
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
you.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
system.
 
You
 
know,
 
then
 
you
 
educate
 
them.
 
The
 
person
 
is
 
not
 
low
 
mood.
 
It's
 
a
 
pattern.
 
Your
 
brain
 
gets
 
into
 
a
 
pattern.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
explain
 
it
 
with
 
an
 
analogy
 
basically.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
talk
 
about
 
what
 
most
 
treatments
 
try
 
to
 
do,
 
you
 
know,
 
by
 
staying
 
in
 
the
 
same,
 
you
 
know,
 
universe
 
of
 
the
 
analogy.
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
say
 
brain
 
stays
 
frozen.
 
And
 
you
 
have
 
this.
 
And
 
I'm
 
probably
 
going
 
to
 
delete
 
that
 
too.
 
But,
 
you
 
know,
 
but
 
what
 
if
 
there
 
was
 
possible
 
to
 
smooth
 
the
 
snow,
 
open
 
up
 
new
 
trails,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
then
 
again,
 
this
 
is
 
possible
 
thanks
 
to,
 
kind
 
of,
 
it's
 
therapy.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
explain
 
it's
 
the
 
same.
 
It's
 
basically
 
the
 
same,
 
like
 
the
 
other,
 
just
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
ad
 
is
 
way
 
different
 
by
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
built
 
it
 
up,
 
you
 
know,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
you.
 
Obviously,
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
the
 
main
 
difference
 
here.
 
The
 
patient,
 
the
 
potential
 
prospect,
 
and
 
the
 
person
 
goes
 
through
 
a
 
journey
 
in
 
which
 
he
 
feels
 
understood,
 
you
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
problem,
 
you
 
educate
 
him
 
about
 
the
 
problem,
 
then
 
you
 
show
 
him
 
there's
 
another
 
way,
 
you
 
talk
 
about
 
the
 
way,
 
you
 
explain
 
why
 
it
 
works,
 
okay?
 
And
 
then
 
you
 
have
 
your
 
offer.
 
 
@39:20
 
-
 
Michael
 
And
 
what
 
about,
 
like,
 
shouldn't
 
it
 
be
 
some
 
kind
 
of,
 
like,
 
image
 
to
 
stop
 
them?
 
 
@39:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
obviously,
 
yeah.
 
This
 
is
 
just
 
a
 
copy.
 
We
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
image.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
where
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
wild.
 
We
 
can
 
create
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
different
 
images.
 
thought
 
about,
 
like,
 
insane
 
things
 
like
 
notes,
 
a
 
person
 
writing
 
a
 
note
 
to
 
himself
 
saying
 
that
 
he's
 
fatigued
 
and
 
tired.
 
iMessage,
 
for
 
example,
 
like
 
a
 
person
 
sending
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
messages
 
for
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
doesn't
 
respond,
 
which
 
usually
 
happens
 
when
 
a
 
person
 
is
 
depressed
 
and
 
doesn't
 
respond
 
to
 
other
 
people.
 
Like,
 
you
 
know,
 
we're
 
gonna
 
get
 
to
 
these
 
people
 
without
 
getting
 
to
 
them,
 
you
 
know?
 
They're
 
just
 
gonna
 
identify
 
with
 
the
 
image
 
itself,
 
which
 
is
 
extremely
 
important.
 
It's
 
not
 
gonna
 
be
 
like,
 
ketamine-assisted
 
therapy
 
and
 
this
 
Spravato
 
nasal
 
spray.
 
Like,
 
who
 
can
 
resonate
 
with
 
that?
 
Like,
 
what
 
the...
 
,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
just
 
not,
 
it's
 
not
 
psychology.
 
That's
 
not
 
marketing.
 
That's
 
.
 
And
 
I
 
hate
 
that.
 
 
@40:07
 
-
 
Michael
 
Well,
 
I
 
mean,
 
there's
 
different
 
components.
 
I
 
mean,
 
there's
 
proximity
 
for
 
Spravato,
 
for
 
Ketamine.
 
Being
 
close
 
to
 
a
 
location
 
also
 
helps
 
because
 
people
 
can't
 
drive
 
afterward.
 
So
 
you're
 
limited
 
in
 
a
 
radius
 
to
 
who
 
you
 
can
 
target,
 
you
 
know,
 
no
 
matter
 
how
 
good
 
your
 
ad
 
is.
 
If
 
we're
 
targeting
 
an
 
hour
 
and
 
15
 
minutes
 
away,
 
they're
 
just
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
drive,
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
ride
 
to
 
do
 
20
 
treatments.

We're
 
going
 
to
 
figure
 
that
 
out
 
before
 
as
 
well.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
what,
 
like,
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
problem
 
with
 
radius
 
right
 
now
 
with
 
people
 
that
 
come?
 
 
@40:37
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
do.
 
I
 
do.
 
Right
 
now.
 
And
 
I've
 
been
 
back
 
and
 
forth
 
with
 
Ketamine
 
Media
 
on
 
this
 
is
 
that
 
we're
 
getting
 
people
 
who
 
are
 
an
 
hour
 
away.
 
And
 
then
 
they're
 
just
 
saying,
 
okay,
 
I
 
can't
 
make
 
it.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
place
 
closer
 
to
 
me.
 
 
@40:47

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
we're
 
basically
 
advertising
 
for
 
our
 
competitors.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
you
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
lower
 
the
 
radius.
 
That
 
solves
 
it.
 
And
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why
 
they
 
didn't
 
do
 
that.
 
So,
 
I
 
mean,
 
or
 
target
 
individual
 
zip
 
codes.
 
area.
 
t,
 
try
 
You
 
you.
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
also
 
possible.
 
can
 
have
 
like
 
a,
 
we
 
can
 
bulk
 
upload
 
like
 
20,
 
30
 
zip
 
codes
 
and
 
just
 
target
 
these
 
areas.

Michael
 
Okay.
 
Do
 
people

That's
 
a
 
good
 
question.
 
Do
 
you
 
read
 
books?
 
 
@41:18
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
do.
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
I'm
 
a
 
good
 
example.

So
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
people
 
read
 
what
 
relates
 
to
 
them
 
and
 
if
 
they
 
find
 
it
 
interesting.
 
And
 
a
 
concept
 
that
 
is
 
being
 
done
 
here
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
take
 
people
 
through
 
a
 
journey
 
and
 
every
 
line
 
connects
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
line,
 
which
 
keeps
 
them
 
reading.
 
 
@41:35

Michael
 
That's
 
the
 
whole
 
process.

That's
 
what
 
marketing
 
is
 
in
 
a
 
sense.
 
That's
 
what
 
copywriting
 
is.
 
No
 
matter
 
how
 
long
 
the
 
copy
 
is.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
it
 
to
 
you.
 
Okay.
 
So,
 
um,
 
oh
 
wait,
 
no,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
best,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
the
 
best
 
example
 
is
 
me,
 
but
 
for
 
example,
 
my
 
ads,
 
you
 
know,
 
people
 
read
 
my
 
ads.
 
 
@41:52
 
-
 
Michael
 
read
 
my
 
whole
 
ad
 
and
 
it
 
wasn't
 
a
 
book.
 
Correct.
 
Correct.
 
I
 
read
 
your
 
ad.
 
I'm,
 
very,
 
you,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it
 
was
 
the.
 
Timing,
 
because
 
I'm
 
very
 
frustrated.
 
could
 
also
 
be
 
the
 
timing.
 
 
@42:05

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
point.
 
When
 
there's
 
a
 
need,
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
read.
 
So
 
it's
 
very
 
simple,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
need.
 
It's
 
basically,
 
Matt
 
sells
 
it,
 
I
 
guess.
 
 
@42:17
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
hear
 
that.
 
So
 
there
 
are
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
questions
 
I
 
have.
 
I
 
get
 
what
 
you're
 
saying
 
regarding
 
pricing.
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
put
 
here
 
$95.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
right
 
price
 
for
 
the
 
consultation
 
fee
 
or
 
not.
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
are
 
different
 
about
 
what
 
we
 
often
 
do,
 
I
 
mean,
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
once
 
they're
 
on
 
the
 
phone,
 
so
 
it
 
doesn't
 
really
 
matter,
 
is
 
that
 
often
 
we're
 
doing
 
the
 
consultation
 
with
 
the
 
provider.
 
It's
 
happening
 
at
 
what
 
we
 
try
 
to
 
do,
 
a
 
consult
 
infusion.
 
They
 
come
 
in,
 
they
 
get
 
a
 
consultation,
 
which
 
usually
 
takes
 
an
 
hour
 
to
 
see,
 
45
 
minutes
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
it
 
is.
 
And
 
if
 
they
 
say,
 
okay,
 
if
 
you're
 
ready
 
to
 
go
 
ahead,
 
we
 
do
 
the
 
infusion
 
right
 
then
 
and
 
there,
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
IV.
 
Spravato
 
is
 
different.
 
So
 
because
 
you
 
need
 
insurance
 
approval,
 
so
 
it
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
little
 
tailored.
 
Do
 
you
 
see
 
like
 
a
 
different
 
approach
 
for
 
each
 
of
 
those?
 
Or
 
is
 
that
 
something
 
that
 
we
 
would
 
kind
 
of
 
flesh
 
out
 
later
 
on?
 
 
@43:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
we
 
can
 
basically
 
build
 
out
 
different,
 
like
 
the
 
ads
 
can
 
be
 
different,
 
the
 
offers
 
can
 
be
 
different
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
product
 
itself.
 
Question
 
is,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
one
 
specific
 
offer
 
and
 
specific
 
treatment,
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
too.
 
Like
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
the
 
most,
 
the
 
best
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
have
 
as
 
a
 
business
 
owner
 
in
 
general
 
is
 
to
 
have
 
focus.
 
And
 
if
 
we,
 
like
 
these
 
two
 
treatments
 
are
 
very
 
much
 
similar,
 
but
 
you,
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
one
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
focus
 
on,
 
and
 
you
 
believe
 
that
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
good
 
for
 
you,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
that
 
you
 
think
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
efficient
 
to
 
you,
 
and
 
you
 
would
 
like
 
it
 
more
 
maybe
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
it's
 
handled,
 
the
 
speed
 
of
 
which,
 
you
 
know,
 
things
 
happen,
 
and
 
the
 
efficiency
 
of
 
things,
 
we
 
should
 
just
 
focus
 
only
 
on
 
that.
 
 
@43:59
 
-
 
Michael
 
Let's
 
see.
 
Let's
 
hope.
 
 
@44:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Let's
 
go.
 
Right.
 
And
 
maybe,
 
you
 
know,
 
here's
 
an
 
example
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
creative
 
you
 
can
 
be.
 
You
 
can
 
offer
 
ketamine
 
on
 
the
 
front
 
end.
 
People
 
say,
 
oh,
 
I'm
 
sorry.
 
This
 
is
 
too
 
expensive.
 
Oh,
 
no
 
problem.
 
We
 
have
 
another
 
thing.
 
It's
 
Pravado.
 
It's
 
covered
 
by
 
insurance.
 
It's
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
from
 
a
 
different
 
molecule
 
and
 
maybe
 
covered
 
by
 
insurance.
 
Would
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
hear
 
about
 
that
 
more?
 
You
 
can
 
just
 
downsell,
 
basically.
 
 
@44:20
 
-
 
Michael
 
That's
 
Pravado.
 
 
@44:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it's
 
not
 
black
 
and
 
white.
 
You
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
play
 
with
 
it.
 
Understand,
 
first
 
of
 
all,
 
what
 
you
 
want
 
and
 
then
 
tailor
 
it
 
to
 
your
 
market.
 
You
 
know?
 
 
@44:31
 
-
 
Michael
 
So.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
there
 
are
 
a
 
couple.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
one
 
question
 
that
 
I
 
need
 
an
 
answer
 
from
 
is
 
the
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
question.
 
Yeah.
 
100%.
 
Before
 
we
 
do
 
anything
 
else.
 
I'm
 
wondering
 
about
 
the
 
wisdom
 
of
 
telling
 
these
 
people
 
at
 
Kennedy
 
Media
 
that,
 
listen,
 
I'm
 
hiring
 
somebody
 
in-house.
 
You
 
play
 
that
 
role.
 
And
 
what
 
are
 
they
 
going
 
to
 
say?
 
Unless
 
I've
 
decided
 
that,
 
you
 
know,
 
you're
 
doing
 
marketing
 
for
 
me
 
in-house.
 
You're
 
focused
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
B2B.
 
Yeah.
 
Marketing,
 
you
 
also
 
know
 
SEO,
 
not
 
SEO,
 
you're
 
doing
 
all
 
this,
 
I'm
 
hiring
 
it,
 
I'm
 
starting
 
to
 
take
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
house,
 
help
 
me
 
with
 
the
 
transition.
 
That
 
might
 
be
 
the
 
simplest
 
way
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
most
 
out
 
of
 
them
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
they'll
 
be
 
sensitive
 
losing
 
the
 
business
 
no
 
matter
 
what,
 
but
 
he's
 
not
 
making
 
that
 
much
 
money
 
off
 
of
 
me.
 
I
 
mean
 
making
 
money
 
off
 
of
 
me,
 
he's
 
not
 
making
 
that
 
much
 
because
 
he
 
has
 
five
 
people,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
time
 
they're
 
spending
 
on
 
my
 
account
 
each
 
month.
 
But,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's
 
one
 
guy
 
for
 
meta
 
ads,
 
there's
 
another
 
guy
 
for
 
Google
 
ads,
 
there's
 
another
 
guy
 
who
 
handles
 
the
 
phones
 
and
 
the
 
go
 
high
 
level
 
support.
 
You
 
know,
 
all
 
these
 
people
 
are
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
each
 
week,
 
you
 
know,
 
there's
 
four
 
or
 
five
 
people
 
on
 
a
 
call,
 
it's
 
adding
 
up
 
for
 
them.
 
And
 
I'm
 
not
 
paying
 
them
 
that
 
much,
 
but
 
also
 
they
 
may
 
be
 
spending
 
pittance
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
were
 
you
 
able
 
to
 
see
 
yesterday
 
how
 
much
 
they're
 
actually
 
spending
 
on
 
the
 
ads
 
and
 
how
 
much
 
is?
 
 
@45:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
We
 
saw
 
how
 
much
 
money
 
they
 
spend
 
on
 
the
 
ads.
 
saw
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
$2,500
 
for
 
Google
 
last
 
month
 
and
 
it
 
was
 
$1,200
 
for
 
Facebook,
 
so
 
it
 
was
 
in
 
total
 
$3,700.
 
 
@45:58
 
-
 
Michael
 
Okay,
 
so
 
if
 
I'm
 
paying
 
them
 
$5.
 
So,
 
yes,
 
I'm
 
paying
 
them
 
basically
 
–
 
if
 
I'm
 
giving
 
them
 
five
 
grand
 
or
 
that's
 
what
 
it
 
was
 
last
 
month,
 
then
 
they're
 
making
 
$1,500,
 
which
 
is
 
similar
 
to
 
what
 
you're
 
doing,
 
right?
 
 
@46:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
very
 
interested
 
as
 
to
 
what
 
–
 
this
 
is
 
weird,
 
you
 
know,
 
because
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
five
 
people
 
on
 
the
 
account,
 
their
 
profit
 
margins
 
must
 
be
 
.
 
 
@46:21
 
-
 
Michael
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
–
 
I
 
mean
 
there
 
are
 
five
 
people.
 
Do
 
they
 
spend
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
time
 
on
 
it?
 
I
 
think
 
they're
 
spending,
 
you
 
know,
 
they're
 
spending
 
30
 
minutes
 
a
 
week
 
with
 
me
 
on
 
the
 
phone.
 
So
 
you're
 
adding
 
up
 
those
 
guys.
 
What
 
are
 
they
 
doing
 
in
 
between?
 
I'm
 
getting
 
–
 
I
 
send
 
them
 
an
 
email.
 
I
 
get
 
a
 
response
 
within
 
24
 
hours
 
usually.
 
 
@46:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
This
 
is
 
extremely
 
weird.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
is
 
–
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
This
 
is
 
–
 
this
 
whole
 
setup
 
is
 
just
 
–
 
doesn't
 
make
 
any
 
sense
 
to
 
me.
 
 
@46:46
 
-
 
Michael
 
don't
 
know.
 
 
@46:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Well,
 
it's
 
not
 
working,
 
so
 
–
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
definitely
 
not
 
working.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
they're
 
doing
 
there.
 
But
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
one
 
thing.
 
There's
 
a
 
thing
 
called
 
Pareto,
 
okay?
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
that
 
the
 
Pareto
 
will
 
–
 
and
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
if
 
we
 
focus
 
on
 
20%
 
of
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
drive
 
you,
 
80%
 
of
 
the
 
results,
 
we
 
don't
 
need
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
just
 
make
 
the
 
creative
 
better,
 
make
 
the
 
funnel
 
better,
 
make
 
the
 
follow-up
 
system
 
better,
 
keep
 
your
 
organic
 
the
 
same
 
way,
 
pump
 
your
 
Google
 
My
 
Business
 
with
 
reviews
 
as
 
well,
 
and
 
just
 
improving
 
it,
 
adding
 
more
 
photos,
 
adding
 
more
 
things
 
to
 
make
 
Google
 
understand,
 
hi,
 
I'm
 
here,
 
it's
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
boost
 
it.
 
And
 
focusing
 
on
 
these
 
three
 
core
 
pillars
 
while
 
running
 
a
 
Google
 
Ads
 
campaign
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
for
 
search,
 
but
 
for,
 
because
 
I
 
saw
 
your
 
Google
 
Ads
 
results,
 
they're
 
horrible.
 
ACTION
 
ITEM:
 
Review
 
current
 
ad
 
spend
 
allocation,
 
consider
 
pausing
 
Google
 
Ads
 
($400/lead)
 
-
 
WATCH
 
Okay,
 
they're
 
not
 
good.
 
Okay,
 
if
 
it's
 
per
 
lead,
 
if
 
it's
 
the
 
$400
 
per
 
lead,
 
that's
 
not
 
good
 
at
 
all.
 
You
 
should
 
turn
 
it
 
off
 
now.
 
Like,
 
I'm
 
dead
 
serious.
 
So
 
focusing
 
on
 
Google
 
would
 
be
 
great
 
for
 
a
 
branding
 
campaign.
 
So
 
for
 
example,
 
when
 
a
 
person
 
sees
 
us
 
on
 
Facebook,
 
they're
 
like,
 
who
 
is
 
this
 
guy?
 
They're
 
searching
 
Ryuketamine.
 
Then
 
we
 
have
 
our
 
keyword
 
of
 
your
 
website
 
just
 
pop
 
up
 
and
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
pop
 
up
 
first,
 
you
 
know?
 
Right.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
spend
 
like
 
way
 
less
 
money
 
on
 
Google
 
itself.
 
And
 
Google
 
can
 
actually
 
act
 
as
 
a.
 
Remarketing
 
campaign,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
as
 
a
 
as
 
a
 
as
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
places
 
you
 
as
 
a
 
person.
 
Oh,
 
I
 
exist.
 
I'm
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
person
 
that
 
advertises
 
on
 
Facebook.
 
And
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
because
 
there's
 
a
 
thing.
 
I
 
told
 
you
 
that
 
but
 
there's
 
a
 
thing
 
called
 
a
 
concept
 
called
 
market
 
awareness
 
levels.
 
It's
 
been
 
invented
 
100
 
years
 
ago
 
by
 
an
 
advertiser
 
called
 
Eugene
 
Schwartz.
 
Okay,
 
that
 
concept
 
basically
 
means
 
that
 
every
 
market
 
has
 
different
 
stages
 
of
 
awareness.
 
So
 
for
 
example,
 
if
 
I
 
would
 
talk
 
to
 
if
 
I
 
would
 
advertise
 
to
 
to
 
ketamine
 
practices
 
that
 
I've
 
never
 
done
 
marketing
 
before,
 
and
 
they've
 
never
 
known
 
what
 
marketing
 
is,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
approach
 
them
 
with
 
Oh,
 
there's
 
a
 
new
 
way
 
to
 
advertise
 
your
 
clinic,
 
come
 
do
 
Facebook
 
ads
 
with
 
us.
 
And
 
that's
 
how
 
it's
 
been
 
like,
 
that's
 
how
 
it
 
was
 
nine
 
years
 
ago.
 
Okay.
 
But
 
there's
 
also
 
a
 
level
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
people
 
on
 
a
 
different
 
because
 
they
 
have
 
different
 
awareness
 
levels.
 
So
 
with
 
ketamine
 
itself,
 
and
 
the
 
whole
 
the
 
I
 
mean,
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
education
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
on
 
this
 
because
 
people
 
are
 
not
 
aware
 
of
 
this,
 
I
 
believe,
 
as
 
they
 
can
 
be.
 
And
 
correct
 
me
 
if
 
I'm
 
wrong,
 
so
 
we
 
use
 
Facebook
 
to
 
educate
 
people
 
on
 
what
 
they
 
can
 
do
 
different,
 
you
 
know,
 
compared
 
to
 
what
 
they're
 
doing
 
right
 
now.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
audience
 
on
 
Facebook,
 
which
 
is
 
problem
 
aware,
 
this
 
audience
 
is
 
problem
 
aware,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
solution
 
aware.
 
So
 
an
 
audience
 
that's
 
solution
 
aware
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
search
 
up
 
ketamine
 
therapy
 
near
 
me.
 
They're
 
like,
 
oh,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
the
 
ketamine
 
can
 
help
 
me.
 
Let
 
me
 
search
 
that
 
up
 
on
 
Google.
 
So
 
it
 
depends
 
on,
 
you
 
know,
 
where
 
our
 
audience
 
is,
 
like
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
are
 
actually
 
searching
 
for
 
ketamine
 
therapy
 
and
 
how
 
many
 
people
 
are
 
just
 
problem
 
aware.
 
They
 
know
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
problem.
 
Their
 
antidepressants
 
are
 
not
 
happy.
 
They're,
 
you
 
know,
 
they
 
have
 
all
 
this
 
going
 
on.
 
So
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
that,
 
too.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
actually
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
research
 
about
 
that.
 
You
 
know,
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
research
 
in
 
your
 
area.
 
See
 
the
 
search
 
volume
 
for
 
ketamine
 
therapy.
 
See
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
in
 
there,
 
and
 
based
 
on
 
that,
 
understand
 
whether
 
Google
 
should
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
asset
 
or
 
not,
 
but
 
right
 
now,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
it's
 
the
 
ads,
 
if
 
it's
 
the
 
funnel,
 
if
 
it's
 
the
 
website,
 
$400
 
per
 
lead
 
does
 
not
 
cut
 
it.
 
 
@50:12

Michael
 
It's
 
just
 
not.
 
It
 
doesn't.

It's
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
turned
 
off
 
right
 
now,
 
burns
 
you
 
money.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
And
 
another
 
thing,
 
one
 
last
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
didn't
 
touch
 
upon
 
is
 
the
 
fact
 
that,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
I
 
didn't
 
tell
 
you
 
that,
 
but
 
when
 
you
 
close
 
people
 
right
 
now,
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
close
 
people,
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
any
 
idea
 
which
 
ad
 
they
 
came
 
from,
 
correct?
 
 
@50:38
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
stores
 
they
 
came
 
from.
 
ad.
 
No,
 
I
 
don't.
 
 
@50:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
the
 
thing,
 
you
 
know?
 
Right.
 
 
@50:45
 
-
 
Michael
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
which
 
ad
 
people
 
come
 
from.
 
Right.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
they're
 
doing
 
the
 
video,
 
they're
 
coming
 
more
 
from
 
video
 
now,
 
but
 
again,
 
they're
 
not
 
sitting
 
there
 
on
 
a
 
weekly
 
meeting
 
saying,
 
this
 
ad
 
did
 
this
 
many
 
leads.
 
This
 
ad
 
did
 
this.
 
I'm
 
not
 
getting
 
that.
 
 
@51:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
it's
 
not
 
even
 
about
 
the
 
leads.
 
It's
 
about
 
understanding
 
because,
 
you
 
know,
 
different
 
ads
 
can
 
give
 
us
 
different
 
quality
 
leads.
 
So,
 
for
 
example,
 
we
 
could
 
test,
 
for
 
example,
 
my
 
ad
 
versus
 
their
 
ad,
 
and
 
their
 
ad
 
could
 
get
 
you
 
20
 
leads,
 
and
 
80%
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
garbage.
 
But
 
my
 
ad
 
will
 
get
 
you
 
seven
 
leads,
 
but
 
five
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
relevant.
 
Which
 
would
 
you
 
rather
 
have?
 
Obviously,
 
my
 
ad.
 
So,
 
you
 
see,
 
it's
 
not
 
about
 
the
 
leads
 
themselves.
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
what
 
type
 
of
 
leads
 
are
 
coming
 
from
 
what
 
ad,
 
so
 
you
 
know
 
which
 
one
 
is
 
better
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
invest
 
based
 
on
 
your
 
goals,
 
and
 
your
 
goals
 
is
 
to
 
close
 
patients,
 
not
 
leads.
 
 
@51:39

Michael
 
Should
 
we
 
be...
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
asked
 
you
 
this
 
yesterday.
 
Is
 
there
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
start
 
advertising?
 
Like,
 
I
 
start
 
giving
 
you
 
like
 
a
 
budget
 
where
 
you
 
start
 
advertising,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
translate.
 
Start
 
to
 
transition
 
out
 
of
 
them
 
so
 
that
 
there's
 
no,
 
like,
 
lag?
 
 
@51:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
actually
 
possible,
 
but
 
we
 
need
 
to...
 
I
 
mean,
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
get,
 
I
 
can
 
show
 
you
 
that
 
right
 
now
 
if
 
it's
 
possible,
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
access
 
to
 
your
 
MetaAd
 
account,
 
not
 
from
 
GoHighLevel,
 
but
 
the
 
proper
 
MetaAd
 
account.
 
 
@52:08
 
-
 
Michael
 
Did
 
we
 
not
 
get
 
access
 
yesterday?
 
 
@52:10
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
forgot.
 
No,
 
we
 
did
 
it
 
on
 
GoHighLevel.
 
We
 
couldn't,
 
there's
 
something
 
wrong
 
with
 
Facebook.
 
 
@52:16
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
access.
 
It's
 
business.facebook.com,
 
right?
 
 
@52:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
and,
 
like,
 
the
 
account
 
that
 
we
 
signed
 
into
 
did
 
not
 
have,
 
like,
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
ads
 
on
 
there,
 
on
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
accounts.
 
 
@52:31
 
-
 
Michael
 
So...
 
Let
 
me
 
just
 
quickly
 
check.
 
 
@52:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's,
 
like,
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
show
 
me
 
that,
 
I
 
could
 
tell
 
you,
 
because
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
start
 
advertising
 
without
 
them
 
knowing
 
that
 
I
 
am
 
advertising.
 
 
@52:42
 
-
 
Michael
 
Right.
 
I'm
 
just
 
having
 
these
 
internet
 
issues,
 
and
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
had
 
a
 
guy
 
here
 
last
 
night
 
working
 
on
 
it.
 
Hold
 
on.
 
Did
 
you
 
live
 
in
 
the
 
States
 
and
 
then
 
move
 
back
 
to
 
Israel,
 
or...?
 
 
@52:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
I
 
met
 
my
 
girlfriend
 
a
 
year
 
and
 
a
 
half.
 
I
 
was
 
living...
 
Israel.
 
I
 
was
 
in
 
the
 
States
 
a
 
month
 
ago,
 
as
 
I've
 
told
 
you.
 
But
 
no,
 
I
 
never
 
lived
 
in
 
the
 
States.
 
 
@53:05
 
-
 
Michael
 
How
 
did
 
your
 
English
 
get
 
so
 
strong?
 
 
@53:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Just
 
practice?
 
It's
 
just,
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
I
 
actually
 
don't
 
know.
 
Where
 
do
 
you
 
live
 
in
 
Israel?
 
Next
 
to
 
Tel
 
Aviv,
 
15
 
minutes
 
from
 
there.
 
It's
 
a
 
called
 
Kiha
 
Ono.
 
 
@53:18
 
-
 
Michael
 
That's
 
where
 
you
 
grew
 
up?
 
 
@53:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
grew
 
up
 
here,
 
yeah.
 
There's
 
a
 
city
 
nearby
 
called
 
Oriyuda.
 
They're
 
basically
 
like
 
one
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
another.
 
 
@53:26
 
-
 
Michael
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
can
 
basically
 
say
 
I
 
grew
 
up
 
here.
 
Hold
 
on.
 
Let
 
me
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
handy.
 
Meta
 
account
 
update.
 
This
 
was
 
in
 
February.
 
said
 
we
 
transition
 
meta
 
ads
 
over
 
to
 
our
 
agency
 
account.
 
take
 
the
 
campaign
 
time
 
to
 
warm
 
back
 
up
 
in
 
less
 
than
 
two
 
weeks
 
a
 
lot.
 
 
@53:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
another
 
email
 
I
 
got
 
from
 
them.
 
Wait,
 
wait,
 
wait.
 
No,
 
no,
 
no,
 
no.
 
This
 
is
 
important.
 
Wait,
 
what
 
did
 
he
 
say
 
there?
 
 
@53:54
 
-
 
Michael
 
What?
 
What
 
did
 
he
 
say
 
here?
 
Hi,
 
Michael.
 
You
 
know,
 
wait.
 
There
 
Where
 
we
 
transition
 
the
 
meta
 
ads
 
over
 
to
 
our
 
agency
 
account,
 
this
 
is
 
in
 
February,
 
it
 
will
 
take
 
time
 
to
 
warm
 
back
 
up
 
with
 
it
 
being
 
less
 
than
 
two
 
weeks
 
live.
 
In
 
the
 
instance
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
get
 
access
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
Ryu
 
ad
 
account,
 
we
 
will
 
keep
 
the
 
agency
 
account.
 
This
 
is
 
because
 
what
 
happened
 
was
 
that
 
my
 
account
 
got
 
flagged.
 
So
 
they
 
started
 
running
 
ads
 
from
 
their
 
agency
 
account
 
until
 
my
 
account
 
got
 
unblocked.

What?

Oriel
 
Mor

You

back,
 
right?
 
 
@54:31
 
-
 
Michael
 
No,
 
I
 
have
 
it
 
back.
 
 
@54:32

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
great,
 
great.
 
We
 
don't
 
want
 
them
 
running
 
ads
 
on
 
their
 
agency
 
account.
 
No.
 
 
@54:37
 
-
 
Michael
 
Big
 
no.
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
was
 
only
 
because
 
I
 
got
 
flagged
 
for
 
ketamine.
 
 
@54:44

Michael
 
Let
 
me
 
see
 
here.
 
Why
 
don't
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
access?
 
It's
 
something
 
that's
 
so,
 
like,
 
not
 
clear
 
to
 
me.
 
Let
 
me
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
info.
 
Let's
 
see
 
here.
 
I'm
 
Good.
 
Thank
 
I
 
have,
 
no
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
this
 
one,
 
um,
 
log
 
in
 
with
 
manage
 
meta
 
account,
 
maybe
 
that's
 
the
 
way
 
I
 
gotta
 
do
 
this.
 
 
@55:30

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
have
 
a,
 
oh
 
wait,
 
you're
 
not

I
 
computer,
 
now
 
I'm
 
logged
 
into
 
my
 
computer
 
through
 
my
 
phone,
 
because
 
I
 
don't
 
have,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
internet
 
right
 
now.
 
Let's
 
see
 
if
 
this
 
works.
 
Um,
 
although
 
I
 
know
 
I
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
my
 
analytics.
 
Uh,
 
oh
 
here,
 
meta
 
business
 
suite,
 
Facebook
 
manager,
 
and
 
Instagram,
 
let
 
see
 
if
 
this
 
takes
 
me
 
there.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
access
 
to
 
this
 
so
 
at
 
least
 
we
 
can
 
see,
 
hold
 
on,
 
are
 
you
 
still
 
with
 
me?

Michael
 
All
 
right,
 
on,
 
only
 
because
 
my,
 
I
 
just
 
gotta,
 
let's
 
see
 
here,
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
log
 
in
 
with
 
Facebook,
 
this
 
should
 
have
 
worked,
 
which
 
one
 
is
 
good
 
here,
 
when
 
we
 
logged
 
in
 
yesterday

Uh,
 
advertise,
 
learn,
 
support.
 
I'm
 
just
 
logging
 
into
 
this
 
ads
 
manager,
 
so
 
I've
 
already
 
had
 
this
 
old
 
stuff
 
that
 
I
 
used.
 
We
 
tried
 
all
 
these,
 
make
 
life
 
better,
 
zero
 
accounts,
 
um,
 
I'll
 
have
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
access
 
it,
 
but
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
I
 
had.
 
I
 
had
 
access
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
so
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
them
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
I
 
can
 
get
 
access
 
to
 
and
 
see.

I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
scripts.
 
We
 
can
 
also
 
hire
 
a
 
company
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
the
 
best
 
choice
 
because
 
when
 
they
 
come
 
there,
 
have
 
professional
 
cameras,
 
they
 
know
 
where
 
to
 
film
 
it.
 
But
 
honestly,
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
do
 
it
 
from...
 
 
@57:28

you

I

Okay,

@57:32

Michael
 
So
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
from
 
an
 
iPhone.
 
I
 
have
 
an

I

@57:38

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
we
 
can
 
definitely
 
do
 
that
 
in
 
your
 
clinic
 
or
 
in
 
your
 
home
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
nice
 
view
 
as
 
well.
 
It
 
can
 
be
 
authentic.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
filmed.
 
What
 
I
 
would
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
professional
 
shooting
 
is
 
testimonials.
 
That's
 
where
 
I
 
would
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
like
 
a
 
content,
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
films
 
videos
 
and
 
that's
 
what
 
they
 
do.
 
Like
 
they
 
do
 
shooting
 
videos.

I
 
have
 
something
 
that
 
I
 
know
 
who
 
has
 
been
 
given
 
access
 
to
 
make
 
life
 
better.
 
This
 
was
 
back
 
in
 
2023,
 
but
 
this
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
kept
 
in
 
the
 
end.
 
You
 
already
 
have
 
access
 
to

that

@1:00:09

Michael
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
would
 
do
 
is
 
I
 
feel
 
much
 
more
 
comfortable
 
like
 
transitioning.
 
First
 
of
 
all,
 
I
 
need
 
an

I
 
mean
 
I
 
can't
 
be
 
stuck
 
with
 
them
 
forever.
 
So
 
if
 
it
 
means
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
lose
 
my
 
data
 
at
 
some
 
point,
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
decision

I
 
don't

No,
 
more

than

I've
 
had,
 
let's
 
see.
 
 
@1:00:40

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
all
 
of

will
 
go

a

or
 
go
 
high

@1:00:43

Michael
 
Yes.
 
Okay.
 
I
 
mean
 
I
 
have
 
electronic

records
 
somewhere
 
else.
 
 
@1:00:49

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
the
 
thing
 
that,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
if
 
they
 
cannot
 
download
 
the
 
notes,
 
it's
 
not
 
possible,
 
which
 
is,
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
very
 
likely.
 
What
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
done?
 
You
 
have...
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
tell
 
your
 
nurse
 
practitioner
 
or
 
somebody,
 
or
 
maybe
 
even
 
you,
 
just
 
go,
 
you
 
know,
 
one
 
by
 
one,
 
you
 
know,
 
get
 
the
 
data
 
one
 
by
 
one,
 
like
 
it
 
is,
 
like,
 
and
 
before,
 
and
 
that's
 
the
 
thing,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
before
 
you
 
tell
 
them,
 
okay,
 
I'm
 
leaving.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
everything,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
secure.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
you,
 
I
 
believe
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
you,
 
like,
 
four
 
hours
 
of
 
work
 
to
 
download
 
every
 
single
 
patient's
 
data.
 
 
@1:01:24
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
right
 
now,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
into
 
this,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
patient
 
here.
 
If
 
I
 
go
 
into
 
their
 
notes,
 
tasks,
 
notes,
 
they're
 
individualized
 
notes,
 
so
 
it's
 
not
 
like
 
I
 
can
 
just,
 
excuse
 
me,
 
every
 
visit,
 
they're
 
having
 
a
 
separate
 
note,
 
so.
 
 
@1:01:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
it's
 
not,
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
there's
 
a
 
note
 
tab
 
for
 
every
 
single
 
contact,
 
is
 
it,
 
is
 
it
 
not,
 
there,
 
I
 
know
 
there's
 
a
 
notes
 
tab
 
for
 
every
 
single
 
contact
 
and
 
go
 
high
 
level.
 
 
@1:01:56
 
-
 
Michael
 
So,
 
that's
 
where
 
we
 
keep
 
information,
 
that's
 
where
 
we
 
keep
 
the
 
information.
 
 
@1:01:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
you
 
have
 
it,
 
you
 
have.
 
I
 
didn't
 
know
 
what
 
in
 
that
 
notes
 
tab
 
of
 
the
 
single
 
contact,
 
so
 
it's
 
like
 
in
 
one
 
place.
 
 
@1:02:03

Okay,
 
great.
 
 
@1:02:04

Oriel

something.
 
 
@1:02:07
 
-
 
Michael
 
No,
 
no.
 
So
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
one
 
patient
 
here,
 
Moshe.
 
He
 
had
 
a
 
treatment
 
on
 
May
 
6th
 
today.
 
Here
 
we
 
share
 
how
 
amazing
 
it
 
is,
 
etc.,
 
etc.
 
Then
 
I
 
have
 
another
 
note
 
for
 
his
 
ninth
 
treatment,
 
another
 
note
 
for
 
his
 
eighth
 
treatment,
 
etc.
 
 
@1:02:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
copy
 
every
 
single
 
patient's
 
one,
 
unless
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
In
 
which,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
not
 
very
 
confident
 
in
 
that.
 
 
@1:02:36
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
them
 
now
 
to
 
understand
 
if
 
that's
 
possible.
 
It'll
 
be
 
helpful
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
give
 
me
 
some
 
clarity.
 
 
@1:02:42
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'll
 
do
 
that
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible.
 
I'm
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
them
 
now,
 
see
 
if
 
there's
 
someone
 
available,
 
see
 
if
 
that's
 
possible.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
main
 
pain
 
point,
 
I
 
guess
 
you
 
could
 
say,
 
in
 
the
 
transition.
 
And
 
if
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
you
 
four
 
hours
 
of
 
work,
 
I
 
mean...
 
 
@1:03:01
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
it's
 
four
 
hours
 
of
 
work.
 
I
 
mean,
 
even
 
if
 
I'm
 
just
 
gathering
 
data
 
from
 
patients
 
for
 
the
 
last
 
year
 
and
 
a
 
half,
 
which
 
is
 
how
 
long
 
I'm
 
working
 
with
 
Ketamine
 
Media,
 
and
 
we've
 
had
 
250
 
new
 
patients
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that,
 
250
 
patients
 
in
 
that
 
time
 
that
 
would
 
do
 
that,
 
and
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
more
 
than
 
that,
 
but
 
I'm
 
just
 
picking
 
a
 
number
 
that's
 
about
 
close,
 
then
 
it's
 
still
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
time.
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
each
 
one,
 
each
 
note,
 
copy
 
it,
 
move
 
it,
 
copy
 
it,
 
move
 
it.
 
It's
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
days
 
of
 
work.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
Maybe
 
days,
 
maybe
 
not.
 
A
 
few
 
people
 
working
 
on
 
it.
 
But
 
also,
 
what
 
about
 
the
 
text
 
messages
 
and
 
voice
 
notes
 
and
 
voice
 
calls?
 
 
@1:03:51

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
not
 
confident
 
we
 
can
 
move
 
that,
 
actually.
 
I'm
 
just
 
not.
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
can
 
export
 
data.
 
Like,
 
of
 
the
 
contacts,
 
names,
 
and
 
phones,
 
and
 
everything,
 
I
 
just
 
don't
 
think
 
it's
 
possible
 
to
 
transfer
 
all
 
this
 
data.
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
it
 
is.
 
And
 
that's
 
.
 
Like,
 
no,
 
it's
 
very
 
,
 
but...

an

so
 
at
 
I
 
can
 
refer
 
back
 
to

Because
 
there's
 
going
 
be
 
so
 
much
 
information
 
that
 
is
 
lost,
 
you
 
know,
 
patients,
 
you
 
patients,
 
you
 
know,
 
said,
 
you
 
know
 
what,
 
I
 
mean,
 
look,
 
not
 
every
 
company
 
has
 
to
 
record
 
all
 
their
 
phone
 
calls
 
and
 
text
 
messages,
 
so
 
it's
 
survivable,
 
but
 
it
 
helps
 
us
 
to
 
look
 
back
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
we're
 
up
 
to.
 
ACTION
 
ITEM:
 
Discuss
 
transition
 
strategy
 
with
 
COO,
 
plan
 
data
 
extraction
 
from
 
Go
 
High
 
Level
 
-
 
WATCH
 
We
 
have
 
their
 
insurance
 
cards,
 
so
 
it's
 
not...
 
At
 
some
 
point,
 
I
 
just
 
hired
 
an
 
operations
 
person,
 
a
 
COO.
 
She
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
some,
 
you
 
know,
 
because
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
good
 
person
 
to
 
run
 
a
 
transition
 
like
 
this.
 
I'm
 
not
 
organized
 
like
 
that.
 
So
 
before
 
that...
 
We'd
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
conversation
 
with
 
her
 
so
 
that
 
we
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we're
 
all
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
page.
 
But
 
I
 
also
 
just
 
–
 
and
 
then
 
on
 
the
 
financial
 
side,
 
it's
 
not
 
something
 
we
 
touched
 
on
 
because
 
some
 
other
 
questions
 
that
 
I
 
had
 
before
 
we
 
really
 
dive
 
into
 
it.
 
I
 
want
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
apples
 
to
 
apples
 
that
 
some
 
kind
 
of
 
pay
 
for
 
performance
 
and
 
not
 
that
 
where
 
I'm
 
paying
 
more
 
than
 
I
 
was
 
before
 
and
 
I
 
still
 
yet
 
have
 
to
 
hire
 
other
 
services
 
like
 
somebody
 
to
 
handle
 
the
 
SEO
 
or
 
the
 
website
 
management,
 
et
 
cetera,
 
which
 
is
 
something
 
–
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
I
 
need
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
that
 
work
 
because
 
it's
 
there.
 
Eventually,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
website
 
anyway,
 
but
 
there
 
are
 
some
 
questions
 
around
 
that
 
also.
 
I'm
 
willing
 
to
 
continue
 
this
 
conversation
 
to
 
work
 
it,
 
but
 
I
 
think
 
there's
 
still
 
some
 
open
 
questions
 
here
 
to
 
solve.
 
And
 
I'm
 
happy
 
to
 
grow
 
with
 
you
 
and
 
I'm
 
more
 
than
 
happy
 
to
 
be
 
generous.
 
So
 
if
 
we're
 
making
 
money
 
and
 
we
 
go
 
from
 
doing
 
X
 
patients
 
to
 
X
 
plus,
 
you
 
know,
 
whatever,
 
five,
 
ten,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
can
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
a
 
tiered
 
approach
 
or
 
something
 
like
 
that
 
for
 
the
 
rewards
 
you
 
based
 
on
 
performance
 
without,
 
you
 
know,
 
over-performing,
 
et
 
cetera.

Mm-hmm.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
Yeah.
 
So,
 
okay,
 
so
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do?
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
next?
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
GoHighLevel.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do?
 
 
@1:06:26
 
-
 
Michael
 
I
 
guess
 
the
 
first
 
question
 
is,
 
what
 
can
 
GoHighLevel
 
do?
 
 
@1:06:28

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
try
 
to
 
get
 
meta
 
access.
 
 
@1:06:31
 
-
 
Michael
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
That's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
my
 
next
 
step.
 
Let
 
me
 
get
 
access
 
to
 
meta.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
him
 
a
 
call
 
and
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
still
 
reach
 
him.
 
Awesome.
 
Okay.
 
No
 
problem,
 
man.
 
All
 
right.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
Bye-bye.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
Bye-bye.

David.
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
teach
 
my
 
brothers
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
campaigns,
 
and
 
they're
 
just,
 
they're
 
not
 
focused.
 
That
 
just
 
leaves
 
me
 
off.
 
Anyways,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
ads

@1:41

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
Let
 
me
 
share
 
my
 
screen.
 
So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
what
 
I've
 
built
 
here.
 
Okay.
 
Can
 
you
 
see
 
my
 
screen?
 
 
@1:59
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yes,
 
it
 
it
 
started.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why.
 
 
@2:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
There
 
it
 
goes.
 
Perfect.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
what
 
did
 
you
 
say?
 
You
 
were
 
about
 
to
 
say
 
something?
 
 
@2:06
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Nope.
 
 
@2:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
you
 
said
 
just
 
something.
 
I
 
thought
 
you
 
were
 
going
 
to
 
say
 
something.
 
 
@2:12
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Oh,
 
I
 
just
 
said
 
it
 
was
 
sharing.
 
 
@2:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
now
 
I
 
have
 
some
 
questions.
 
I
 
looked
 
at
 
the
 
targeting
 
that
 
you
 
did
 
here.
 
And
 
I
 
did
 
some
 
research
 
as
 
well.
 
And
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
questions.
 
So
 
first
 
question
 
is,
 
so
 
there's
 
a
 
zip
 
code.
 
That's
 
nice.
 
That's
 
good.
 
I
 
saw
 
that
 
here.
 
Like,
 
is
 
there
 
a
 
specific
 
reason
 
as
 
to
 
why
 
there's
 
only
 
women?
 
Why
 
the
 
age
 
targeting
 
is
 
from
 
18?
 
Why
 
do
 
we
 
include
 
all
 
these
 
interests?
 
 
@2:46
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
And
 
just
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
experimenting,
 
seeing
 
how
 
it
 
was
 
go.
 
 
@2:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I'm
 
open
 
to
 
doing
 
anything.
 
So,
 
okay.
 
 
@2:54
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
the
 
one
 
thing
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
saw.
 
So
 
in
 
our
 
clinic,
 
of
 
I'll
 
kids.
 
So
 
schedule,
 
Um,
 
there's
 
just,
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
women
 
are
 
easier
 
to
 
target,
 
but
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
should
 
take
 
that
 
off
 
and
 
do
 
both.
 
 
@3:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
really,
 
like,
 
have
 
you,
 
did
 
you
 
notice
 
a
 
pattern
 
with
 
men
 
in
 
general,
 
or?
 
 
@3:18
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
No,
 
it's
 
just
 
that
 
women
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
really
 
seek
 
intervention.
 
 
@3:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@3:26
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
understand.
 
Again,
 
like,
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
our
 
client
 
for
 
the
 
last
 
three
 
years,
 
like,
 
70%
 
are
 
women.
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
for
 
the
 
time
 
being,
 
because
 
we're
 
just
 
so,
 
you
 
know,
 
trying
 
to
 
keep
 
costs
 
down.
 
I
 
was
 
like,
 
let's
 
just
 
find
 
women
 
with
 
the
 
marketing
 
until
 
we
 
kind
 
of
 
get,
 
like,
 
going.
 
So,
 
but
 
now
 
I'm
 
open
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
targeting
 
both.
 
 
@3:55
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
let's
 
see
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
here.
 
So
 
I
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
there
 
was,
 
yeah.
 
Okay.
 
 
@4:00
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
No,
 
there's
 
also
 
males
 
here.
 
 
@4:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Like
 
males
 
left
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
details
 
here,
 
like
 
$11.
 
Here
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
males,
 
for
 
example,
 
like
 
it's
 
a
 
women
 
video
 
too,
 
$122,
 
not
 
good.
 
Female,
 
two
 
here,
 
men,
 
didn't
 
really
 
spend
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
money.
 
So
 
there's
 
one
 
ad
 
that
 
really
 
spoke
 
to
 
men.
 
Seems
 
like
 
it's
 
a
 
how
 
to
 
beat
 
the
 
oppression
 
one.
 
 
@4:22
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
that-
 
That's
 
something
 
that's
 
a
 
picture.
 
It's
 
a
 
super
 
simple
 
ad
 
too,
 
like
 
that
 
one.
 
 
@4:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
You
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
complicate
 
stuff.
 
Yeah,
 
exactly.
 
So
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
now,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
ask
 
you,
 
like,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
targeting
 
based
 
on
 
zip
 
codes
 
and
 
income
 
based
 
on
 
zip
 
codes
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
better
 
way
 
to
 
go,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion.
 
 
@4:47
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
That's
 
what
 
I
 
did
 
too.
 
 
@4:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
I
 
added
 
like
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
zip
 
codes
 
in
 
here.
 
Yeah.
 
As
 
well.
 
Um,
 
as
 
I
 
said,
 
like
 
I
 
upped
 
the
 
age
 
range
 
from
 
26
 
to
 
65.
 
 
@4:58
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Do
 
you
 
guys
 
get
 
65
 
plus?
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
get
 
a
 
lot.
 
 
@5:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
we
 
should,
 
we
 
should
 
remove
 
all
 
the
 
targeting
 
options.
 
Honestly.
 
Yeah,
 
let's
 
try
 
it.
 
If
 
you
 
notice,
 
if
 
you
 
notice
 
like
 
a
 
pattern
 
with
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
like
 
broke,
 
can't
 
pay
 
deductibles,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
we
 
can
 
always
 
change
 
it
 
back.
 
But
 
because
 
we're
 
in
 
a
 
local
 
area,
 
like
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
get
 
some
 
context.
 
In
 
Israel,
 
for
 
example,
 
when
 
we
 
advertise
 
to
 
the
 
whole
 
nation,
 
and
 
it's
 
like
 
eight,
 
nine
 
million
 
people,
 
I
 
don't
 
do
 
targeting.
 
Yeah,
 
but
 
all
 
health
 
is
 
a
 
different
 
animal,
 
though,
 
too,
 
right?
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
But
 
in
 
a
 
local
 
area,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
because
 
it's
 
so
 
small,
 
Facebook
 
can
 
really
 
figure
 
out
 
who
 
you
 
want
 
really,
 
really
 
fast,
 
too.
 
They
 
have
 
insane
 
amounts
 
of
 
data.
 
 
@5:43
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Okay.
 
 
@5:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
so
 
for
 
example,
 
in
 
Israel,
 
what
 
we,
 
yeah,
 
let
 
me
 
show
 
you,
 
like
 
the
 
most
 
perfect
 
example
 
of
 
an
 
Israeli
 
client.
 
 
@5:52
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
 
@5:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
yeah,
 
there's
 
these
 
guys.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
how
 
about
 
DJ
 
course?
 
Yeah,
 
remember,
 
I
 
don't
 
remember
 
me
 
telling
 
you
 
that,
 
but
 
basically,
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
main
 
campaign
 
that
 
we've
 
been
 
running.
 
I
 
tried
 
also
 
landing
 
page,
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
I
 
upped
 
it
 
in
 
like
 
two
 
last
 
two
 
days,
 
because
 
it
 
didn't
 
work
 
at
 
all.
 
Probably
 
gonna
 
turn
 
that
 
off.
 
So
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
that
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
these,
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
are
 
open,
 
open
 
audiences,
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
like,
 
say,
 
Oh,
 
wait,
 
who,
 
who
 
the
 
wants
 
to
 
be
 
a

know,
 
it's
 
like
 
a
 
very
 
small
 
audience.
 
 
@6:28

Chris

Yeah,
 
it's
 
still,
 
I
 
still
 
put
 
it
 
open.
 
 
@6:30

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
Facebook
 
somehow
 
got
 
the
 
audience.
 
It
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
creative
 
and
 
the
 
messaging
 
that
 
you
 
have,
 
and
 
not
 
necessarily
 
on
 
the
 
on
 
the
 
technical
 
things
 
that
 
you
 
do
 
in
 
the

itself,
 
like
 
the

and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.

Let
 
the

Exactly.
 
Find

Oriel

yeah,
 
I

yeah.
 
And
 
also
 
your

your
 
messaging
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
dictate
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
your,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
dictate
 
your
 
results.
 
If
 
your
 
ad
 
is
 
good,
 
it's
 
gonna
 
work.
 
If
 
it's
 
not
 
good,
 
it's
 
not

Hey,

at

can
 
you
 
say
 
something

you

share
 
so
 
people
 
will

Oh,
 
I
 
would
 
rather
 
not
 
do
 
it
 
because
 
if
 
it's
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
has
 
depression,
 
he
 
wouldn't
 
want
 
to
 
share
 
it
 
with
 
other
 
people
 
because
 
it
 
would
 
make
 
him
 
seem
 
kind
 
of
 
weird,
 
like,
 
what's
 
going
 
on
 
with
 
you?
 
 
@7:23

Chris

That's
 
a

really
 
good

Oriel

(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
You're
 
right.
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
dangerous.
 
So
 
that's
 
what
 
we're
 
doing.
 
We
 
have
 
these
 
two
 
ones.
 
We
 
can
 
also
 
duplicate
 
this.
 
And
 
this
 
is
 
like
 
stupid
 
simple,
 
but
 
this
 
just
 
works.
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
will
 
work.
 
Also,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
create
 
you
 
the
 
ad
 
scripts
 
as
 
well.
 
You
 
can
 
technically
 
take
 
this
 
script
 
and
 
film
 
it.
 
If
 
you
 
want
 
to,
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
that.
 
If
 
you
 
need
 
any
 
help
 
from
 
me,
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
send
 
you...
 
Oh,
 
I
 
actually
 
have
 
a...
 
be
 
tell
 
tell
 
want,
 
tell
 
You're
 
I
 
Video
 
Ad
 
Mastery,
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
that
 
too,
 
put
 
in
 
the
 
Zoom
 
like,
 
you
 
already
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
talk.
 
Where
 
the
 
is
 
my,
 
wait,
 
how
 
do
 
I
 
go
 
back
 
to
 
Zoom
 
here?
 
What
 
is
 
going
 
on?
 
Oh,
 
okay.
 
So
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
the
 
doc
 
info
 
for
 
that.
 
Super
 
simple,
 
not
 
very
 
complicated,
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
like
 
a
 
baseline
 
for
 
that.
 
I
 
need,
 
the
 
last
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
submit
 
application
 
event
 
on
 
the
 
landing
 
page.
 
Because
 
what
 
I
 
did
 
is
 
that
 
I
 
cloned
 
the
 
funnel
 
step.
 
I
 
cloned
 
the
 
funnel
 
step
 
and
 
I
 
basically
 
had
 
this
 
new
 
landing
 
page
 
instead
 
of
 
changing
 
the
 
one
 
that
 
we
 
already
 
have.

No.

So
 
let's
 
go
 
through
 
it
 
now.
 
I
 
looked
 
at
 
the...
 
Also,
 
I
 
analyzed
 
the
 
stats
 
from
 
the
 
past
 
as
 
well,
 
and
 
I
 
put
 
less
 
emphasis
 
on
 
desktop
 
because
 
97%
 
based
 
on
 
your
 
data
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
97%
 
of
 
traffic.

Oriel

So
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
the
 
desktop
 
just
 
so
 
you
 
see
 
the
 
messaging
 
and
 
stuff.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
new
 
hook.
 
Obviously,
 
if
 
370
 
grand
 
reputation
 
got
 
their
 
life
 
back
 
in
 
21
 
days
 
with
 
TMS
 
therapy
 
and
 
how
 
you
 
can
 
too,
 
even
 
if
 
you've
 
tried
 
meds
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
change
 
that.
 
Then
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
change
 
this
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
form.
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
change
 
that.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
put
 
this
 
here
 
to
 
create
 
some
 
trust,
 
credibility,
 
then
 
covered
 
by
 
insurance.
 
Then
 
I
 
put
 
gene
 
store
 
here
 
just
 
as...
 
It's
 
way
 
shortened
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
understand,
 
like
 
a
 
person
 
that
 
actually
 
did
 
it.
 
Then
 
we
 
go
 
and
 
explain
 
why
 
nothing
 
ever
 
worked.
 
We
 
have
 
this,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
copy
 
here,
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
copy.
 
This
 
is
 
from
 
the
 
guy
 
that
 
I
 
showed
 
you
 
from
 
Alpha
 
Omega
 
Wellness.
 
I
 
really
 
like
 
this
 
picture.
 
So
 
I
 
used
 
it
 
too.
 
And
 
basically
 
what
 
I
 
do
 
here,
 
if
 
you
 
notice,
 
is
 
I
 
have
 
pictures
 
here,
 
every
 
like
 
three
 
or
 
four
 
sentences
 
to
 
break
 
the,
 
break
 
the
 
eye.
 
So
 
it's
 
easier
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
read.
 
So,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
add
 
this
 
again
 
here
 
with
 
the
 
Harvard,
 
Mayo,
 
and
 
Stanford
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Then
 
we
 
have
 
call
 
to
 
action.
 
Then
 
we
 
explain
 
how
 
the
 
process
 
works.
 
So
 
free
 
consult,
 
mental
 
health
 
evaluation
 
and
 
custom
 
plan.
 
And
 
then
 
the
 
treatment
 
begins,
 
then
 
another
 
call
 
to
 
action.
 
And
 
there's
 
frequently
 
asked
 
questions
 
here
 
in
 
case
 
people
 
have
 
questions,
 
you
 
know,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
picture
 
here.
 
need
 
to
 
move
 
this
 
picture
 
over
 
here,
 
but
 
it's
 
not,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
important,
 
honestly.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
again,
 
apply
 
below
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
change
 
some
 
stuff
 
on
 
desktop,
 
even
 
though
 
it's
 
not
 
important
 
at
 
all,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion,
 
like
 
mobile.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
basically
 
a
 
landing
 
page.
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
do
 
a
 
test
 
here.
 
I'll
 
do
 
a
 
test
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
hooks
 
and
 
have
 
like
 
how
 
to
 
feel
 
normal
 
again
 
within
 
21
 
days
 
with
 
TMS
 
therapy
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Try
 
some
 
shorter
 
stuff
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
too.
 
There's
 
also
 
three
 
bullet
 
points
 
here,
 
by
 
the
 
way.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
maybe,
 
just
 
let
 
me
 
show
 
it
 
here.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why
 
I
 
opened
 
up
 
the
 
page
 
like
 
that
 
in
 
another
 
way.
 
 
@11:32

Chris

Did
 
you
 
see
 
how
 
that
 
looked

Oriel
 
Mor

Yep,
 
on
 
the
 
top,
 
yeah.
 
Of
 
course.
 
So
 
this
 
is
 
how
 
it
 
looks
 
on
 
mobile.
 
You
 
have
 
these
 
three
 
bullet
 
points
 
here,
 
tell
 
me
 
more
 
info,
 
then
 
it
 
takes
 
them
 
again.
 
This,
 
this,
 
this,
 
this,
 
all
 
that,
 
call
 
to
 
action,
 
process
 
works,
 
questions,
 
meet
 
the
 
doctor,
 
another
 
call
 
to
 
action,
 
then
 
the
 
address.
 
So
 
extremely
 
simple.
 
has
 
all
 
the,
 
all
 
the,
 
all
 
the
 
stuff
 
that
 
it
 
needs.
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
this
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
last.
 
I
 
So
 
the
 
last
 
page
 
will
 
convert
 
better.
 
also
 
saw
 
your
 
conversion
 
rates.
 
So
 
a
 
cool
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
here.
 
No,
 
that's
 
not
 
what
 
I
 
want.
 
A
 
cool
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
here.

Okay.
 
So
 
what
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
in
 
general
 
just
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
is
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
go,
 
for
 
example,
 
let's
 
take,
 
let's
 
take
 
this
 
month.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
not
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
data.
 
So
 
you
 
have
 
16
 
website
 
appointments
 
applications
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
166
 
clicks.
 
What
 
does
 
that
 
mean?
 
That
 
means
 
that
 
from
 
166
 
clicks
 
on
 
the
 
link,
 
only
 
16
 
people
 
submitted
 
their
 
application,
 
which
 
is,
 
which
 
is
 
kind
 
of,
 
kind
 
of
 
good.
 
We
 
can
 
do
 
it
 
better.
 
It
 
can
 
become
 
better
 
because
 
the
 
offers,
 
there's
 
not
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
friction.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
push
 
it
 
to
 
15,
 
20%.
 
And
 
I
 
believe
 
that's
 
possible.
 
So,
 
and
 
when,
 
and
 
if
 
we
 
push
 
it
 
to
 
15,
 
20%,
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
happen
 
is
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
booking,
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
appointment
 
schedule
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
down
 
to
 
$17.
 
it.
 
look
 
And
 
then
 
imagine
 
that
 
we
 
also
 
get
 
the
 
click-through
 
rate
 
up
 
to
 
1.5%,
 
then
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
down
 
to
 
$12.

You
 
know,
 
that's
 
where
 
the
 
real
 
stuff
 
begins.
 
So,
 
and
 
also
 
I
 
look
 
here,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
like,
 
did
 
this
 
audience
 
get
 
like
 
lower
 
quality
 
leads?
 
Because
 
the
 
price
 
per,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
cost
 
per
 
result
 
was
 
way
 
lower
 
here.
 
 
@13:24

Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
I've
 
had
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
people
 
come
 
through
 
with
 
a
 
certain
 
insurance
 
that,
 
well,
 
there
 
might
 
be
 
some
 
changes
 
though.
 
So
 
it's,
 
it's
 
good
 
that
 
like
 
our
 
cost
 
per
 
lead
 
is
 
gone.
 
Well,
 
we've
 
seen
 
some
 
fake

too.

at
 
it.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
depending,
 
like,
 
let's
 
see
 
where
 
this,
 
when
 
was
 
this
 
turned
 
off?
 
This
 
was
 
turned
 
off
 
on
 
February
 
11th.
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
remember?

like
 
it
 
being
 
a

the

something,

crazy
 
this
 
is.
 
landing
 
page.
 
So
 
the
 
21
 
days,
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
think
 
through
 
the
 
verbiage
 
of
 
that.

I'm
 
with
 
you.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
most
 
of
 
it's,
 
you
 
go
 
five
 
days
 
a
 
week
 
for
 
six
 
weeks.
 
Now,
 
there's
 
some
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
late
 
responders,
 
so.

I
 
believe
 
that,
 
I
 
believe
 
that's
 
the
 
thing,
 
like,
 
because
 
we,
 
we
 
see
 
the,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
stat
 
here.
 
92%
 
of
 
people
 
achieve.
 
Significant
 
improvement
 
within
 
21
 
days.
 
 
@15:03

Chris
 
Shepard
 
Well,
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
people,
 
it
 
takes
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
longer
 
than
 
21
 
days.
 
might
 
be
 
at
 
treatment
 
28
 
or
 
30,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
I'm
 
saying?
 
 
@15:10

Oriel

Is
 
that
 
another
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
think
 
you
 
can
 
set
 
an
 
expectation
 
with
 
them,
 
like
 
before
 
the
 
treatment
 
begins?
 
 
@15:15
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Like
 
literally
 
90
 
plus
 
percent
 
of
 
patients
 
are
 
getting
 
better
 
within
 
that
 
21
 
days.
 
 
@15:21

Oriel

Yeah,
 
so
 
you
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
set
 
an
 
expectation
 
with
 
them.
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
that's
 
going
 
be
 
a
 
problem
 
on
 
the
 
front
 
end,
 
correct
 
me
 
if
 
I'm
 
wrong.
 
 
@15:27

Awesome,
 
okay.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
this
 
is
 
supposed
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
converting
 
machine,
 
converting
 
monster.
 
This
 
is
 
all
 
my
 
foyers
 
are
 
poured
 
into
 
this.
 
Yeah.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
this.
 
The
 
only
 
last
 
things
 
that
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
take
 
care
 
of,
 
basically,
 
is
 
I
 
want
 
us
 
to
 
run.
 
Can
 
you
 
see?
 
Oh,
 
my
 
God.
 
did
 
that.
 
It's
 
like
 
in
 
different
 
profiles.
 
I
 
always
 
need
 
to
 
unshare
 
and
 
reshare.
 
It's
 
annoying
 
me.
 
Let's
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
can
 
change
 
that.
 
Just
 
switch
 
screens.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
you.
 
No,
 
I
 
always
 
have
 
to
 
un-share
 
and
 
then
 
re-share.

So
 
that
 
one,
 
that's
 
for
 
like
 
the
 
generalized
 
public,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
got
 
it
 
for
 
adolescents.
 
 
@16:12
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
can.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
there's
 
two
 
options
 
here.
 
 
@16:15
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
finish
 
with
 
adolescents.
 
 
@16:16

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
there's
 
two
 
options.
 
One,
 
we
 
can
 
just
 
choose
 
because
 
there's
 
these
 
two
 
ads,
 
and
 
there's
 
four
 
more
 
ads,
 
ad
 
creatives,
 
and
 
there's
 
also
 
one
 
more
 
text
 
as
 
well.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
like
 
way
 
more
 
stuff
 
to
 
test.
 
So
 
the
 
question
 
is,
 
is
 
there,
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
through,
 
you
 
can
 
go
 
through
 
Slack
 
real
 
quick
 
and
 
tell
 
me
 
which
 
one
 
you
 
love
 
the
 
most
 
because
 
there's
 
also
 
the
 
notes
 
ad,
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
like
 
the
 
notes
 
ad
 
a
 
lot
 
because
 
it's
 
also
 
dynamic,
 
like
 
it's
 
animated
 
because
 
I
 
took
 
a
 
recording
 
of
 
a
 
screen
 
when
 
I
 
wrote,
 
so
 
that
 
also
 
hooks
 
people
 
more
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
I'm
 
writing.
 
And
 
there's
 
also
 
like
 
the
 
more,
 
there's
 
the
 
more,
 
what's
 
it
 
called?
 
 
@16:54

Chris

These
 
are
 
the
 
attachments.
 
 
@16:56

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
and
 
there's
 
more
 
of
 
the
 
design
 
that's
 
too,
 
like
 
with
 
the
 
whole.
 
And
 
sitting
 
down
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
brain,
 
with
 
the
 
person
 
inside
 
the
 
brain,
 
which
 
is
 
like
 
red,
 
you
 
know,
 
so
 
that's
 
also
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
test
 
out.

basically,
 
this

like,
 
a
 
one
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
just
 
hooked.
 
them
 
to
 
wait
 
until
 
they
 
watch.

Chris

if
 
it's

@19:04

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Another
 
one,
 
I
 
just
 
did
 
a
 
different
 
headline.
 
Yeah.
 
Same
 
thing,
 
different
 
headline.
 
Oh,
 
I
 
think
 
that,
 
oh,
 
that's
 
the
 
same
 
one.
 
Wait.
 
 
@19:15
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
they
 
were
 
both
 
the
 
same.
 
 
@19:19

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)

other

Chris

Oriel

In
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
I
 
wrote,
 
there's
 
a
 
new
 
way
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
treatment-resistant
 
depression.
 
Read
 
this
 
post
 
to
 
learn
 
what
 
it
 
is.
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
second
 
one.
 
It's
 
basically
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
That's
 
the
 
headline.
 
And
 
there's
 
also
 
these
 
four
 
creatives
 
here.
 
So
 
there's
 
the
 
woman
 
one,
 
the
 
brain
 
one,
 
and
 
basically
 
the
 
same,
 
just
 
a
 
different
 
picture.
 
One.
 
So
 
that's
 
one.
 
And
 
then
 
you,
 
if
 
you
 
move
 
to
 
the
 
right,
 
there's
 
also
 
another
 
one
 
here.
 
So
 
basically
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
Which
 
ones
 
do
 
you
 
like
 
the
 
most?
 
That's
 
the
 
question.
 
And,
 
like,
 
how
 
much
 
do
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
test,
 
you
 
know?
 
 
@20:04
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
I
 
mean,
 
that's
 
good.
 
I
 
mean,
 
why
 
don't
 
we
 
just
 
run
 
all
 
three
 
to
 
see
 
which
 
ones
 
convert
 
better?

what
 
do
 
you

Is
 
there
 
a
 
specific
 
one,
 
specific
 
ones
 
that
 
you're,
 
like,
 
you
 
like
 
the
 
most?

all
 
good.
 
 
@20:39

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
mean...
 
Yeah,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
it
 
depends
 
on,
 
like...
 
Because
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
budget,
 
we
 
should
 
test,
 
like,
 
more
 
carefully.
 
 
@20:48
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
can
 
increase
 
the
 
budget
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
to
 
run

like,
 
a
 
week.

@20:53

Chris

Because
 
let's
 
just
 
test
 
it,
 
because
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
test
 
this
 
out
 
for
 
not
 
only
 
me
 
but
 
the
 
other
 
clinics,
 
so...

@20:58

Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
I
 
agree.
 
I'll
 
increase
 
the
 
 
@21:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
I
 
can
 
also
 
increase
 
the
 
budget
 
from
 
now
 
on
 
if
 
you
 
want.
 
can
 
just
 
talk
 
about
 
it
 
before
 
and
 
I
 
can
 
alert
 
you.
 
Or
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
increase
 
it,
 
can
 
also
 
do
 
it
 
yourself
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
more
 
control.
 
 
@21:11
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Depends
 
on
 
you,
 
though.
 
Why
 
don't
 
I
 
just
 
do
 
all
 
four
 
and
 
then
 
run
 
like
 
$100
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
week?
 
 
@21:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
With
 
that
 
budget,
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
run
 
the
 
notes
 
ad.
 
Or
 
did
 
you
 
like
 
that
 
less?
 
 
@21:27
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
like
 
that.
 
So
 
you
 
basically
 
will
 
place
 
that
 
recording?
 
 
@21:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Obviously,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
edit
 
it.
 
It's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
from
 
the
 
moment
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
start
 
typing.
 
 
@21:42
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Let's
 
just
 
try
 
it.
 
Again,
 
this
 
is
 
where
 
we
 
got
 
to
 
experiment
 
to
 
figure
 
out,
 
out
 
of
 
all
 
these,
 
which
 
works
 
best.
 
So
 
let's
 
just,
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
got
 
to
 
start
 
trying
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
and
 
see
 
what,
 
again,
 
let
 
the
 
market
 
decide
 
what's
 
best.
 
 
@21:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
I
 
also
 
wanted
 
to
 
try
 
Gene's
 
new
 
ad.
 
Well,
 
it'd
 
be.
 
I
 
also
 
added
 
like
 
subtitles.
 
I
 
started
 
from
 
her
 
talking
 
about
 
I've
 
struggled
 
for
 
34
 
years
 
with
 
depression.
 
So
 
it's
 
like
 
way
 
more
 
on
 
point.
 
It's
 
like
 
half
 
the
 
time
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
before.
 
I
 
just
 
read
 
to
 
understand.
 
But
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
I
 
already
 
put
 
her
 
video
 
on
 
the
 
landing
 
page
 
too.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
I'm
 
like,
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
whether
 
we
 
should
 
put
 
her
 
because
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like
 
repeated,
 
repetitive,
 
you
 
know,
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
is
 
specifically
 
for
 
Jean's
 
ad,
 
I
 
could
 
edit
 
Katrina's
 
ad,
 
like
 
Katrina's
 
video
 
and
 
then
 
show
 
them
 
Katrina's
 
story
 
instead.
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that.
 
But
 
do
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
that?
 
 
@22:40
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure.
 
Yeah.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
think
 
again,
 
I
 
like
 
your
 
idea
 
getting
 
it
 
shorter
 
would
 
be
 
good.
 
And
 
then
 
again,
 
I
 
just,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
we
 
just
 
got
 
to
 
test
 
them
 
all
 
and
 
see.
 
 
@22:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
Okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
start
 
with
 
these
 
ads.
 
We're
 
gonna,
 
we're
 
not
 
gonna
 
do
 
Jean
 
you
 
know.
 
And
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
results,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
works
 
best,
 
and
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to,
 
you
 
know,
 
stop
 
things,
 
keep
 
on
 
going
 
with
 
things.
 
I
 
also
 
added
 
the
 
UTM
 
into
 
the
 
text
 
itself,
 
like
 
what
 
I
 
told
 
you,
 
remember,
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
tracks
 
the
 
URL.
 
So
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
understand
 
which
 
campaign
 
to
 
come
 
from,
 
from
 
now
 
on.
 
And,
 
oh,
 
and
 
one
 
last
 
thing,
 
I
 
looked
 
at
 
the
 
high
 
level,
 
and
 
man,
 
your
 
funnels
 
are
 
confusing
 
me,
 
like
 
your
 
pipelines.
 
Oh,
 
the
 
pipelines.
 
Yeah,
 
there's
 
so
 
many
 
pipelines,
 
I
 
don't
 
understand
 
what's
 
supposed
 
to
 
go
 
where.
 
 
@23:30
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Okay,
 
I
 
can
 
help
 
you
 
go
 
through
 
that.

Okay,
 
so
 
let's
 
go,
 
let's
 
do
 
that
 
for
 
a
 
second.
 
So,
 
okay,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
like
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
pipelines
 
here.
 
 
@23:44
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
the
 
main
 
one
 
right
 
now,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
one
 
I
 
use,
 
so
 
this
 
one
 
right
 
here,
 
TMS

@23:50

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@23:51
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
And
 
then
 
all
 
the
 
leads
 
are
 
coming
 
through
 
the
 
external
 
lead.
 
 
@23:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
so
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
put
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
external
 
lead
 
opportunity
 
when
 
they...
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
I
 
got
 
you.
 
Cool.
 
With
 
the
 
automation,
 
is
 
there
 
any
 
resources
 
that
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
send
 
them,
 
like
 
right
 
then
 
and
 
there
 
when
 
they
 
get
 
the
 
message?
 
 
@24:18
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
What
 
do
 
I
 
currently
 
have?
 
 
@24:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
You
 
have
 
the
 
snippets
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
We
 
can
 
take
 
links
 
from
 
the
 
snippets
 
if
 
you
 
want.
 
 
@24:30
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
just
 
have
 
something
 
like,
 
thanks
 
a
 
lot
 
for
 
filling
 
out
 
the
 
form.
 
Someone
 
from
 
BrainStim
 
TMS
 
will
 
be
 
following
 
up
 
with
 
you.
 
 
@24:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
think
 
they
 
just
 
get
 
a
 
text
 
and
 
an
 
email.
 
Okay,
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
going
 
make
 
it
 
way
 
more
 
personalized
 
though.
 
I'm
 
to
 
say
 
like,
 
hi,
 
it's
 
Chris
 
from
 
BrainStim
 
TMS.
 
I
 
appreciate
 
you
 
for
 
filling
 
out
 
the
 
form
 
and
 
taking
 
a
 
step
 
towards
 
feeling
 
better.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
call
 
you,
 
me
 
or
 
someone
 
from
 
my
 
team
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
call
 
you
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
couple
 
of,
 
I'm
 
in
 
between
 
treatments,
 
so
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
call
 
you
 
in
 
the
 
next.
 
Lesley
 
Sure,
 
I've
 
tried.
 
You
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
minutes
 
or,
 
you
 
know,
 
I'll
 
call
 
you
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible,
 
ideally
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
couple
 
of
 
minutes.
 
But
 
if
 
not,
 
just
 
expect
 
a
 
call
 
from
 
this
 
number.
 
 
@25:09
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
then
 
that's
 
where
 
I
 
was
 
thinking
 
from,
 
I
 
guess
 
it's
 
good
 
just
 
to
 
send
 
them
 
up
 
just
 
a
 
typed
 
out
 
text.
 
You
 
don't
 
need
 
a
 
video
 
for
 
that.
 
 
@25:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Wait,
 
what's
 
your
 
idea?
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
have
 
in
 
your
 
hand?
 
 
@25:28
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So,
 
remember
 
how
 
you
 
can,
 
so
 
actually
 
it's
 
in
 
that
 
video
 
that
 
I
 
sent
 
you
 
on
 
Slack?
 
 
@25:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
the
 
iPhone
 
video?
 
 
@25:37
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
where
 
you
 
can
 
like,
 
again,
 
so
 
it
 
showed
 
how
 
the
 
lead
 
came
 
in,
 
Ohio
 
takes
 
the
 
info,
 
it
 
creates
 
the
 
personalized
 
video
 
to
 
send
 
back
 
to
 
the.
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
thinking
 
of
 
like
 
sending
 
a
 
personalized
 
video
 
through
 
HeyGen,
 
like,
 
hey,
 
it's
 
Chris.
 
Hey,
 
you
 
know,
 
so
 
like
 
Patty,
 
hey,
 
Pat,
 
it's
 
Chris
 
with
 
BrainStim.
 
Thanks
 
a
 
lot
 
for
 
filming.
 
We
 
were
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you,
 
you
 
know,
 
again,
 
whatever
 
the
 
talk
 
track
 
is.
 
 
@26:06
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
good.
 
Do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
that?
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
can,
 
I
 
can
 
look
 
into
 
that.
 
 
@26:10
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
again,
 
that,
 
remember,
 
it's
 
about
 
developing
 
a
 
relationship.
 
So
 
the,
 
the,
 
the
 
patient's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like,
 
wow,
 
they
 
sent
 
me
 
a
 
personalized
 
video.
 
 
@26:19
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Does
 
it
 
look,
 
does
 
it
 
look
 
realistic
 
though?
 
 
@26:22
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Do
 
you
 
think
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
realistic?
 
Again,
 
I've
 
seen
 
some
 
that
 
looked
 
really
 
realistic,
 
some
 
that
 
have
 
it.
 
 
@26:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I
 
got,
 
it's
 
got
 
to
 
try
 
it
 
and
 
see.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
I'll
 
work
 
on
 
that.
 
I'll
 
work
 
on
 
that.
 
 
@26:33
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
And
 
then
 
meanwhile,
 
we're
 
just
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
automation
 
set
 
up,
 
you
 
know.
 
we
 
go
 
to
 
Heygen,
 
which
 
account
 
should
 
I
 
sign
 
up
 
for,
 
for
 
Heygen?
 
So
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
different
 
plans
 
here.
 
Can
 
you
 
go
 
to
 
Heygen
 
real
 
quick?
 
 
@26:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
So,
 
okay,
 
so
 
there's
 
also
 
API
 
pricing,
 
which
 
API
 
is
 
what
 
we
 
need.
 
 
@27:07
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
was
 
thinking
 
one
 
is
 
like
 
$80
 
US
 
a
 
month
 
because
 
it
 
gives
 
you
 
two
 
people,
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
was
 
the
 
scale.
 
 
@27:36
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Do
 
we
 
need
 
two
 
seats
 
though?
 
We
 
can
 
just
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
account.
 
don't
 
see
 
a
 
reason
 
to.
 
Unless
 
there's
 
something
 
else
 
here.
 
 
@27:44
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
There's
 
4K,
 
30
 
minutes.
 
But
 
it
 
says
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
two
 
seats.
 
You
 
can't
 
just
 
do
 
$39.
 
 
@27:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
But
 
what's
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
this
 
one
 
and
 
this
 
one?
 
 
@27:58
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
30
 
minutes.
 
 
@28:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
30
 
minutes
 
here,
 
too,
 
no?
 
Where
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
that
 
we
 
need
 
two
 
seats
 
minimum
 
in
 
the
 
creator?
 
Oh,
 
no,
 
that's
 
in
 
team.
 
But
 
do
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
get
 
team?
 
 
@28:14
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Scroll
 
up
 
a
 
little
 
bit.
 
 
@28:20
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Video
 
generation
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
The
 
main
 
difference
 
here
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
two
 
custom
 
video
 
avatars,
 
two
 
custom
 
interactive
 
avatars,
 
unlimited
 
avatar
 
photo
 
avatars.
 
Edit.
 
 
@28:32
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
clone
 
myself
 
and
 
then
 
clone
 
Dr.
 
Singula.
 
 
@28:38
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
need
 
the
 
team
 
one
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
that.
 
 
@28:41
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
clone
 
myself,
 
but
 
I
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
clone
 
Dr.
 
 
@28:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Singula.
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
get
 
it.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
you
 
should
 
get
 
the
 
team
 
then.
 
 
@28:48
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
 
@28:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No
 
problem.
 
 
@28:52
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
I'll
 
get
 
that
 
one.
 
 
@28:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
and
 
I'll
 
look
 
into
 
the
 
API
 
and
 
then
 
I'll
 
ask
 
my
 
friend.
 
 
@29:00
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I'll
 
ask
 
my
 
friend
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
help
 
us.
 
Should
 
I
 
do
 
a
 
background
 
with
 
a
 
green
 
screen,
 
or
 
what
 
do
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
do,
 
or
 
should
 
I
 
just
 
film
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
clinic?
 
 
@29:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
in
 
the
 
clinic,
 
man.
 
 
@29:10
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Right.
 
 
@29:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
is
 
a
 
reason
 
not
 
to,
 
like,
 
have
 
a
 
white
 
coat
 
on,
 
look
 
authoritative,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Very
 
simple.
 
If
 
you
 
have,
 
like,
 
in
 
your
 
clinic,
 
like,
 
a
 
nice
 
background,
 
like,
 
there's
 
green,
 
like,
 
trees
 
in
 
behind
 
you
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff,
 
like
 
a
 
window,
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
that,
 
too.
 
 
@29:26
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Cool,
 
so,
 
okay.
 
Alright,
 
I'll
 
work
 
on
 
that.
 
 
@29:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
So,
 
I,
 
what
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
change
 
the
 
form
 
on
 
the
 
landing
 
page,
 
change
 
the,
 
like,
 
create
 
the
 
automation.
 
I'll
 
put
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
external,
 
like,
 
in
 
the,
 
like,
 
external
 
leads
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I
 
hope
 
that
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to,
 
like,
 
deal
 
with
 
this,
 
because
 
it's
 
like,
 
ah,
 
this
 
looks
 
so
 
overwhelming.
 
Yeah.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
UTMs
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
basically
 
it,
 
I
 
think,
 
like,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
live.
 
I'm
 
finishing
 
with
 
that
 
and
 
we
 
go
 
live,
 
basically.
 
good.
 
I'm
 
basically.
 
 
@30:00
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
things.
 
So
 
we
 
think
 
we've
 
got
 
some
 
accounts
 
that
 
don't
 
need
 
the
 
call
 
center.
 
So
 
just
 
like
 
fine
 
tune.
 
think
 
we're
 
going
 
to,
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
basically
 
Yeah,
 
in
 
a
 
week
 
we'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
see
 
which
 
ads
 
are
 
working.
 
We
 
can
 
just
 
copy
 
and
 
paste
 
them
 
already.
 
You
 
and
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
like
 
our
 
presentation.
 
I
 
already
 
have
 
a
 
presentation
 
built
 
out
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
with
 
the
 
customers.
 
So
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
through
 
and
 
re-customize
 
that.

Do
 
you
 
think
 
we
 
need
 
a
 
presentation?
 
 
@30:37
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
walk
 
through
 
the
 
doctors
 
and
 
show
 
them
 
exactly
 
what
 
we're
 
doing.
 
 
@30:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@30:44
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Guys
 
have
 
high
 
anxiety,
 
convert
 
like
 
signing
 
up.
 
 
@30:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
 
@30:53
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
you
 
can
 
just
 
call
 
and
 
say,
 
hey,
 
we're
 
just
 
there.
 
Everyone's
 
such
 
visual
 
learners
 
and
 
understand.
 
sorry.
 
not.
 
see.
 
I'm
 
We're,
 
All
 
 
@31:00
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing,
 
what
 
I'm
 
doing,
 
actually,
 
is
 
I
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
hop
 
on
 
the
 
calls,
 
I
 
talk
 
to
 
people,
 
they're
 
just
 
telling
 
me,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
my
 
brain
 
works?
 
Yeah,
 
sure.
 
And
 
I'll
 
just
 
open
 
up
 
the
 
Google
 
Docs,
 
throw
 
them
 
examples
 
of
 
ads.
 
I
 
show
 
them
 
how
 
we
 
track
 
the
 
stats.
 
I
 
show
 
them
 
how
 
we
 
set
 
goals.
 
I
 
show
 
them,
 
like,
 
creative
 
examples.
 
I
 
show
 
them
 
campaigns
 
that
 
are
 
running.
 
And
 
I
 
tell
 
them,
 
yeah,
 
this
 
is
 
basically
 
it.
 
 
@31:21
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
This
 
is,
 
like,
 
super
 
simple.
 
So,
 
but
 
have
 
you,
 
okay,
 
so
 
how
 
many
 
accounts
 
have
 
you,
 
I
 
mean,
 
how
 
many
 
accounts
 
have
 
you
 
signed
 
up
 
so
 
far?
 
 
@31:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
have
 
about
 
six
 
more.
 
Currently,
 
like,
 
there's
 
one
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
pay
 
me,
 
another
 
one
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
complete
 
the
 
onboarding
 
form,
 
another
 
one
 
that
 
wants
 
to
 
leave
 
his
 
marketing
 
agency.
 
There's,
 
like,
 
there's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
people
 
there,
 
like,
 
in
 
different
 
stages,
 
basically.
 
 
@31:44
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Okay.
 
And
 
so,
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
price
 
point,
 
I
 
mean,
 
has
 
it
 
been
 
over
 
$5,000?
 
 
@31:50
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
hasn't
 
been.
 
 
@31:51
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
You're
 
right.
 
So,
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
like,
 
when
 
you
 
start
 
saying
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
spend
 
$5,000
 
or
 
$7,000,
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
know
 
every...
 
So
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
spend
 
time
 
just
 
to
 
kind
 
of,
 
and
 
again,
 
we,
 
we
 
can
 
just
 
go
 
with
 
it
 
and
 
try
 
it.
 
But
 
again,
 
everyone
 
that
 
I've
 
talked
 
to,
 
they
 
really
 
like
 
going
 
through
 
and
 
understanding
 
everything.
 
 
@32:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@32:18
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Agreeable.
 
Very
 
organized
 
fashion,
 
step
 
one,
 
step
 
two,
 
just
 
slide
 
by
 
slide.
 
 
@32:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
get
 
that.
 
 
@32:27
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
get
 
that.
 
It's
 
easy
 
when
 
you're
 
like
 
saying,
 
Oh,
 
I'm
 
only
 
going
 
to
 
charge
 
you
 
like
 
this
 
much,
 
like
 
very
 
little
 
this
 
month.
 
 
@32:35
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Like
 
everyone
 
just
 
goes
 
with
 
it.
 
 
@32:37
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
But
 
when
 
you
 
start
 
asking
 
for
 
like
 
a
 
big
 
payment,
 
they
 
want
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
like
 
a
 
big
 
plan.
 
 
@32:44
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
I
 
agree.
 
 
@32:50
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
the
 
other
 
thing,
 
so
 
this
 
is
 
to
 
change
 
subjects
 
a
 
little
 
bit.
 
So
 
I've
 
got
 
a
 
huge
 
opportunity
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
like
 
I
 
was
 
telling
 
you,
 
like
 
we
 
got
 
to,
 
well,
 
Focus
 
on
 
the
 
mental
 
health
 
and
 
the
 
TMS
 
and
 
ketamine
 
area,
 
but
 
my
 
really,
 
really
 
good
 
friend,
 
he's
 
an
 
interventional
 
radiologist.
 
He
 
wants
 
us
 
to
 
help
 
him
 
with
 
his
 
practice.
 
My
 
question
 
to
 
you
 
is,
 
so
 
I
 
basically
 
told
 
him
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
between
 
$5,000
 
and
 
like
 
$8,000
 
a
 
month.
 
 
@33:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
 
@33:28
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
But
 
so
 
he
 
needs
 
a
 
whole
 
new
 
website
 
built
 
out.
 
 
@33:33
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@33:35
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Like
 
how
 
much
 
would
 
we
 
charge
 
to
 
build
 
out
 
a
 
website
 
if
 
he
 
signs
 
like
 
a
 
12-month
 
contract
 
with
 
us?
 
 
@33:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
my
 
colleagues.
 
Okay.
 
There's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
on
 
Pfizer.
 
 
@33:52
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
They
 
do
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
job.
 
So
 
the
 
thing
 
is,
 
is
 
like,
 
I've
 
got
 
like
 
six
 
other
 
websites
 
that
 
we
 
basically
 
need
 
to
 
clone
 
this
 
morning.
 
Just...
 
You
 
know,
 
repurpose
 
and
 
create
 
his
 
own.
 
So
 
it's
 
like
 
an
 
easy
 
build,
 
whether
 
AI
 
can
 
help
 
build
 
the
 
website
 
or
 
we
 
just
 
outsource
 
that
 
to
 
somebody.
 
But
 
I've
 
got
 
all
 
the
 
samples
 
of
 
the
 
websites.
 
So
 
the
 
great
 
thing
 
is
 
they
 
actually,
 
it's
 
a
 
pretty
 
high
 
ticket
 
item
 
for
 
their
 
clinic.
 
 
@34:24
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@34:25
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
It's
 
usually
 
$1,000
 
to
 
$6,000
 
of
 
treatment.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
really
 
good
 
niche
 
for
 
us
 
once
 
we
 
get
 
through
 
the
 
mental
 
health
 
stuff.
 
And
 
he's
 
like,
 
I'll
 
be
 
like,
 
he
 
wants
 
to
 
help
 
us
 
like
 
with
 
his
 
other
 
friends
 
that
 
are
 
doctors
 
across
 
the
 
country.
 
 
@34:45
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So.
 
Okay.
 
Sounds
 
interesting.
 
Yeah.
 
I
 
mean,
 
that's
 
possible.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
like
 
add
 
somebody
 
else
 
into
 
the
 
mix,
 
this
 
should
 
be
 
the
 
last
 
one.
 
Yeah.
 
Like,
 
I
 
understand
 
like
 
the
 
value
 
that.
 
If
 
he
 
gets
 
a
 
good
 
job,
 
then
 
he's
 
going
 
to
 
offer
 
some
 
more
 
people,
 
more
 
clients,
 
and
 
there's
 
nothing
 
that
 
I
 
myself
 
cannot
 
craft
 
because
 
I
 
know
 
marketing.
 
So
 
that's
 
like
 
a
 
good
 
point.
 
Then
 
fine.
 
Yeah,
 
sure.
 
We
 
just
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
complicate
 
it
 
too
 
much.
 
This
 
should
 
be
 
the
 
last
 
like
 
avenue
 
that
 
we
 
expand
 
upon,
 
in
 
my
 
opinion.
 
 
@35:22
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
All
 
right.
 
 
@35:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
back
 
to
 
this.
 
 
@35:27
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
live.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
double
 
check
 
all
 
that.
 
Can
 
you
 
go
 
into
 
the,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
the,
 
want
 
to
 
double
 
check
 
the
 
workflows
 
right
 
now
 
with
 
the
 
lead
 
coming
 
in
 
or
 
you
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
later?
 
 
@35:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
now
 
if
 
you
 
want.
 
 
@35:48
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
mean,
 
let's
 
go
 
through
 
it
 
now.
 
I
 
got
 
time.
 
 
@35:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
no
 
problem.
 
So
 
which
 
one
 
is
 
the
 
Grand
 
Rapids?
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Bookly,
 
Workflow,
 
is
 
this
 
the
 
one?
 
 
@36:08
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Last
 
update.
 
 
@36:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
assuming
 
that
 
that's
 
Facebook,
 
no,
 
that's
 
the
 
Facebook
 
survey
 
submitted.
 
Calls
 
are
 
no,
 
educational
 
videos,
 
brainstem,
 
appointment
 
confirmation,
 
no,
 
and
 
Workflow.
 
Do
 
they
 
get
 
a
 
message
 
currently
 
when
 
they
 
leave
 
the
 
details
 
from
 
the
 
landing
 
page?
 
 
@36:28
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
go
 
to
 
Facebook
 
marketing.
 
 
@36:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Is
 
that
 
the
 
one?
 
No,
 
that's
 
not
 
the
 
one.
 
I
 
actually
 
started
 
building
 
this,
 
so
 
it's
 
the
 
one
 
I'm
 
working
 
on.
 
 
@36:36
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
.
 
 
@36:39
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
not
 
obviously
 
that
 
complicated,
 
you
 
know,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
hard.
 
There's
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
things
 
here.
 
 
@36:46
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
no,
 
it's
 
not
 
in
 
that.
 
So
 
wait,
 
go
 
to,
 
okay,
 
go
 
to
 
brainstem.
 
Wait,
 
go
 
to
 
that
 
one
 
right
 
there.
 
What's
 
that?
 
Oh,
 
I
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
what
 
that
 
is.
 
 
@37:01
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Let's
 
see
 
if
 
there's
 
something
 
here,
 
I
 
mean,
 
so
 
I
 
think
 
it's,
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
which
 
one
 
it
 
is,
 
wait,
 
wait,
 
go,
 
okay,
 
do
 
this,
 
go
 
open,
 
open
 
another
 
tab.
 
think
 
that's
 
this
 
one.
 
Another
 
tab?
 
 
@37:19
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
go
 
to
 
opportunities
 
and
 
right-click,
 
yeah,
 
and
 
then,
 
oh,
 
see
 
where
 
they
 
left
 
the
 
details
 
from,
 
okay.
 
 
@37:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
the
 
automations,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
right.
 
 
@37:39
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So,
 
with
 
that
 
one
 
came
 
in
 
on
 
the
 
13th,
 
so
 
on
 
the
 
bottom
 
left
 
over
 
there,
 
it'll
 
say,
 
see
 
workflow
 
created
 
bottom
 
left.
 
 
@37:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
.
 
I'll
 
keep
 
going
 
down
 
it.
 
Yeah,
 
yeah,
 
yeah.
 
 
@37:53
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yep.
 
Yeah,
 
workflow.
 
That's
 
really
 
nice
 
they
 
did
 
that.
 
 
@38:04
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
that's
 
the
 
one.
 
So
 
SMS
 
internal
 
notification,
 
what's
 
this
 
one?
 
Oh,
 
they
 
don't
 
get
 
a
 
message
 
here.
 
 
@38:14
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
click
 
on
 
that.
 
 
@38:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
this
 
one
 
or
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
one?
 
 
@38:28
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
don't
 
care,
 
whatever
 
you
 
think.
 
 
@38:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Depends
 
on
 
what
 
feels
 
more
 
comfortable
 
for
 
you,
 
like
 
what's
 
going
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
more
 
clarity,
 
because
 
that's
 
the
 
main
 
consideration
 
here.
 
 
@38:42
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Will
 
there
 
be
 
a
 
way
 
of
 
filtering
 
it
 
to
 
know
 
where
 
that
 
leak
 
came
 
from?
 
 
@38:50
 
-

Yeah,
 
100%,
 
of
 
course.
 
 
@38:53
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
if
 
you
 
think
 
it's
 
fine
 
just
 
using
 
this
 
one,
 
we
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
one.
 
 
@38:57
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Or
 
if
 
we
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
separate
 
one.
 
.
 
heavily
 
you.
 
Okay.
 
No
 
problem.
 
I'll
 
figure
 
that
 
out.
 
I'll
 
see
 
if
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
this
 
or
 
not.
 
 
@39:07
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I'll
 
update
 
you.
 
Yeah,
 
click
 
on
 
the
 
SMS.
 
 
@39:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What's
 
the
 
notification
 
say?
 
Click
 
on
 
that.
 
That's
 
for
 
you.
 
 
@39:12
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
click
 
on
 
it,
 
though.
 
 
@39:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
For
 
instance,
 
new
 
assessment
 
lead,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
 
@39:17
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Oh,
 
yeah.
 
I
 
get
 
a
 
text.
 
That's
 
actually
 
not
 
working
 
for
 
some
 
reason.
 
know
 
why,
 
but
 
I'll
 
do
 
it.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
 
@39:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
And
 
then...
 
Should
 
you
 
use
 
a
 
notification?
 
You
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
that.
 
You
 
can
 
also
 
add
 
like
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
they...
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
I
 
see
 
you
 
didn't
 
do
 
that
 
here.
 
You
 
can
 
just
 
add
 
the...
 
You
 
can
 
have
 
like
 
a
 
notes
 
thingy
 
here,
 
and
 
we
 
can
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
client
 
that
 
he
 
responded
 
with.
 
 
@39:46
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
just...
 
So
 
I
 
just
 
text
 
message
 
on
 
my
 
phone
 
because
 
like
 
when
 
the
 
lead
 
comes
 
in,
 
then
 
I
 
lap
 
on
 
the
 
app
 
and
 
I
 
actually
 
call
 
the
 
patients
 
really
 
quick.
 
 
@39:54
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
know.
 
But
 
in
 
general,
 
you
 
can
 
keep
 
the
 
notes
 
there.
 
Like
 
it
 
doesn't
 
escape.
 
 
@39:59
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Usually
 
when
 
I'm...
 
On
 
the
 
phone,
 
I
 
just
 
log
 
in
 
to
 
their
 
contact
 
card
 
and
 
see
 
all
 
their
 
stuff.
 
 
@40:05
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
Versus
 
that
 
I'm
 
getting
 
a
 
text
 
message.
 
 
@40:08
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Because
 
I'm
 
actually
 
taking,
 
so
 
when
 
I
 
call
 
the
 
patient,
 
I'm
 
actually
 
taking
 
notes.
 
 
@40:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
Makes
 
sense.
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
it
 
basically.
 
We
 
work
 
with
 
that
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
go
 
live.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
more
 
questions
 
I
 
think
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
ask?
 
 
@40:31
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
No,
 
I
 
think
 
we're
 
good.
 
 
@40:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome,
 
no
 
problem.
 
One
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
is
 
that
 
what
 
we're
 
doing
 
with
 
the
 
model
 
itself,
 
because
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
paid
 
booking.
 
Well,
 
there's
 
no
 
way
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
take
 
any
 
deposits
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
month.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
that?
 
 
@40:52
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
We
 
just
 
have
 
to,
 
we
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
like
 
set
 
up
 
a,
 
what's
 
the
 
account,
 
the
 
online.
 
very
 
much.
 
it.
 
Oh,
 
you're
 
saying
 
for
 
the
 
patients?
 
 
@41:05
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
for
 
the
 
patients,
 
too.
 
Like,
 
we
 
don't
 
take
 
a
 
deposit
 
for
 
the
 
patients.
 
And
 
also
 
for
 
my
 
model,
 
like
 
working
 
with
 
you.
 
Because
 
as
 
I
 
told
 
you,
 
I
 
have
 
this
 
model
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
take
 
the
 
deposits
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
month.
 
We
 
don't
 
take
 
deposits
 
right
 
now.
 
So
 
that's
 
on
 
my
 
end,
 
also,
 
the
 
thing
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
take
 
care
 
of.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
think?
 
Like,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
that?
 
 
@41:22
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
within
 
GoHighLevel,
 
it
 
can
 
accept
 
payments
 
through
 
that,
 
right?
 
 
@41:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it
 
can
 
accept
 
payments.
 
 
@41:29
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
why
 
don't
 
we
 
just
 
do
 
it
 
within
 
the
 
system?
 
Or,
 
again,
 
I
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
expertise
 
in
 
next.
 
I've
 
never
 
done
 
it.
 
But
 
whatever
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do,
 
we
 
can
 
set
 
it
 
up.
 
 
@41:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
 
@41:43
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
Stripe?
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
 
@41:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
we
 
just,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
connect
 
Stripe
 
to,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
connect
 
Stripe
 
to
 
GoHighLevel.
 
then
 
the
 
question
 
is,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
charge
 
for...
 
...
 
...
 
...
 
...
 
...
 
The
 
deposit
 
from
 
people
 
after
 
you
 
get
 
on
 
the
 
phone
 
with
 
them
 
to
 
book
 
the
 
consultation
 
in
 
the
 
clinic.
 
That's
 
a
 
question.
 
 
@42:08
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
I
 
want
 
to,
 
but
 
I
 
guess.
 
Yeah,
 
let's
 
let's
 
not
 
charge
 
the.
 
Like,
 
so,
 
man,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
I'm
 
kind
 
of
 
split
 
on
 
this.
 
I've
 
just
 
had
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
patients
 
where
 
they're
 
like,
 
they
 
didn't
 
want
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
the
 
consultation.
 
 
@42:38
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@42:40
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
And
 
I
 
felt
 
like
 
when
 
we
 
did,
 
but
 
we
 
tried
 
this
 
a
 
long,
 
long
 
time
 
ago,
 
and
 
the
 
numbers
 
improved
 
dramatically
 
when
 
we
 
didn't
 
do
 
a,
 
when
 
we
 
did
 
a
 
no
 
charge
 
consultation.
 
 
@42:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
Okay.
 
If
 
that's
 
your
 
data
 
point,
 
then
 
fine,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
get
 
that.
 
So
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to.
 
sense.
 
Okay,
 
100%.
 
 
@43:02
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Ketamine
 
clinic
 
and
 
stuff,
 
yeah,
 
we'll
 
try
 
it,
 
but
 
again,
 
the
 
numbers
 
were
 
so
 
much
 
greater
 
with
 
no
 
charge
 
consultations.
 
 
@43:14
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
our
 
model
 
of
 
working
 
then,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that?
 
 
@43:31
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
you're
 
saying
 
when
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
brand
 
new
 
account?
 
 
@43:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
also
 
a
 
brand
 
new
 
account.
 
With
 
a
 
brand
 
new
 
account,
 
like
 
we're
 
taking
 
money
 
from
 
them.
 
For
 
example,
 
when
 
I
 
work
 
with
 
you
 
guys,
 
the
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
positioned
 
my
 
model
 
is
 
I
 
take
 
the
 
deposits
 
from
 
the
 
patients
 
when
 
they
 
book
 
the
 
call.
 
We
 
don't
 
have
 
deposits
 
now.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
like
 
for
 
this
 
payment
 
model
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
set
 
up,
 
me
 
and
 
you?
 
That's
 
the
 
main
 
question.
 
So
 
for
 
example,
 
with
 
the
 
ketamine.
 
ketamine.
 
ketamine.
 
And
 
I'm
 
ordering
 
right
 
now,
 
she's
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
$29
 
consultation,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
deposit
 
for
 
that.
 
Another
 
one
 
is
 
doing
 
the
 
same
 
thing.
 
Another
 
one
 
is
 
just
 
pay
 
me,
 
flat
 
out
 
simple.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
like
 
with
 
me
 
and
 
you?
 
That's
 
the
 
question.
 
 
@44:15
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Can
 
you
 
just
 
hold
 
on
 
one
 
second?
 
 
@44:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Oh,
 
never
 
mind.
 
 
@44:22
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
we
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
put
 
it
 
through
 
our
 
Skype
 
account?
 
 
@44:27
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
mean?
 
 
@44:30
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
brand
 
new
 
practice
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
charge
 
all
 
the
 
new
 
leads,
 
consultation,
 
appointment
 
charge,
 
right?
 
 
@44:39
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that.
 
No,
 
that's
 
not
 
the
 
question.
 
That's
 
not
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about.
 
I'm
 
talking
 
about
 
like
 
myself
 
here,
 
not
 
about
 
the
 
brand
 
new
 
accounts.
 
Yeah,
 
I'm
 
about
 
myself
 
because
 
we,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
that's
 
what
 
I
 
was,
 
yeah,
 
okay.
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
had
 
a
 
miscommunication
 
there.
 
 
@44:56
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
sorry.
 
I
 
thought
 
we
 
were
 
talking
 
about
 
like
 
the
 
patient
 
charges.
 
So
 
So
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
just
 
got
 
to
 
set
 
up
 
Stripe,
 
make
 
sure
 
you
 
have
 
access,
 
and
 
I
 
have
 
access,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
bank
 
account.
 
I
 
wonder
 
if
 
there's
 
a
 
way
 
where
 
it
 
can
 
just
 
get
 
automatically
 
divided.
 
So
 
maybe
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
jump
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
Sarah
 
to
 
talk
 
through
 
that.
 
 
@45:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
that
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@45:28
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
let's
 
get
 
Sarah
 
on
 
the
 
account
 
because
 
she's
 
good
 
at
 
some
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
can,
 
again,
 
just
 
create
 
a
 
Stripe
 
account.
 
 
@45:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
between
 
us,
 
with
 
the
 
patients,
 
can
 
also,
 
like,
 
we
 
can
 
have,
 
like,
 
automatic
 
payouts
 
or
 
something.
 
We
 
can
 
figure
 
that
 
out.
 
That's
 
not
 
a
 
problem.
 
So
 
that,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
figure
 
that
 
out.
 
That's
 
okay.
 
And
 
what
 
about,
 
the
 
last
 
thing
 
I
 
think
 
is
 
about
 
your
 
clinic
 
as
 
well.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
in
 
that
 
part?
 
Because
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
Deposit
 
payments
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
and
 
that's
 
my
 
model
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
month
 
with
 
people.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
like
 
the
 
most
 
thing
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
do?
 
You
 
know,
 
did
 
invest
 
a
 
ton
 
of
 
RNG
 
into
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
So
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
on
 
your
 
side?
 
 
@46:16
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
like
 
what,
 
like
 
what
 
the
 
clinic
 
is
 
going
 
to,
 
I'm
 
confused
 
by
 
the
 
question.
 
 
@46:26
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
we,
 
we
 
are
 
running
 
ads
 
for
 
your
 
clinic,
 
right?
 
Fetting
 
the
 
ads,
 
bid
 
all
 
that,
 
the
 
landing
 
page,
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
a
 
good
 
compensation
 
model
 
for
 
me
 
would
 
be
 
because
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
this
 
$30
 
deposit
 
thing
 
based
 
on
 
what
 
we
 
work
 
together,
 
you
 
know?
 
 
@46:46
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
think?
 
I
 
pay
 
you?
 
 
@46:51
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Depends
 
on
 
you.
 
It
 
really
 
depends
 
on
 
you.
 
Like
 
I
 
want
 
to,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
feel
 
like
 
this
 
is
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
I
 
get
 
the
 
worth
 
from
 
our
 
job,
 
even
 
though
 
like
 
I
 
take
 
way
 
more
 
money
 
from
 
other
 
people.
 
 
@46:59
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
doesn't
 
matter.
 
That's
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
build
 
something
 
else
 
here.
 
Yeah.
 
 
@47:02
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
In
 
some
 
way,
 
I
 
do
 
feel
 
like
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
value
 
that
 
I
 
do
 
bring
 
to
 
the
 
table
 
here.
 
 
@47:07
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
have
 
worked
 
a
 
lot
 
on
 
this,
 
a
 
lot.
 
Absolutely,
 
yeah.
 
 
@47:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
it
 
really
 
depends
 
on,
 
like,
 
what
 
you
 
think
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
fair
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that?
 
 
@47:16
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Again,
 
feel
 
like
 
we're
 
creating
 
the
 
product
 
and
 
we're
 
beta
 
testing
 
it,
 
but
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
you
 
get
 
some
 
money
 
coming
 
in.
 
 
@47:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
why
 
don't
 
you
 
just
 
pay,
 
like,
 
$1,000
 
right
 
now?
 
Okay,
 
that
 
sounds
 
good.
 
No
 
problem.
 
You
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
now.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
set
 
up
 
Stripe
 
as
 
well.
 
If
 
you
 
want,
 
I
 
can
 
talk
 
to
 
my
 
payment
 
processor.
 
The
 
main
 
problem
 
with
 
them
 
is
 
that
 
they
 
don't
 
accept
 
American
 
credit
 
cards,
 
from
 
what
 
I
 
understand.
 
So
 
we
 
can
 
try
 
that
 
out
 
if
 
you
 
want.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
wait
 
for
 
Stripe,
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
that
 
too.
 
So
 
it
 
all
 
depends
 
on
 
you.
 
Yeah,
 
let's
 
set
 
up
 
the
 
Stripe.
 
 
@47:52
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Two
 
is,
 
it'll
 
be
 
nice
 
that
 
everything's
 
all
 
vertically
 
integrated
 
in
 
GoHilo.
 
GoHilo!
 
I
 
mean,
 
the
 
Stripe?
 
 
@48:04
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
You
 
talk
 
about
 
Stripe?
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
 
@48:07
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
like
 
the
 
contracts
 
to
 
the
 
clients
 
will
 
be
 
in,
 
go
 
high
 
level.
 
So
 
we
 
actually
 
need
 
to
 
build
 
an
 
agency
 
account,
 
right?
 
 
@48:21
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
I
 
mean,
 
it's
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
we
 
build
 
as
 
time
 
goes
 
on
 
as
 
well.
 
We
 
see
 
we
 
get
 
feedback
 
from
 
the
 
patients.
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
that
 
hard,
 
honestly.
 
I
 
think
 
like
 
the
 
contract
 
stuff
 
and
 
the
 
onboarding,
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
like
 
the
 
easy
 
stuff.
 
We
 
can
 
also
 
at
 
some
 
point,
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
SOPs
 
and
 
automations,
 
how
 
to
 
automate
 
the
 
onboarding
 
process
 
completely.
 
You
 
know,
 
as
 
I
 
told
 
you
 
with
 
creating
 
the
 
Google
 
Drive
 
folders,
 
creating
 
the
 
cell
 
accounts
 
automatically
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
too.
 
So
 
that
 
can
 
happen
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@48:50
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
And
 
so
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
build
 
out
 
a
 
brand
 
new,
 
well,
 
do
 
I
 
already
 
have
 
an
 
account
 
like
 
for
 
P2P
 
for
 
clients?
 
That's
 
it.
 
So
 
again,
 
where,
 
you
 
know,
 
we
 
call
 
the
 
client,
 
we
 
set
 
up
 
the
 
appointment,
 
they're
 
like,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
move
 
forward,
 
we
 
basically,
 
within
 
GoHighLevel,
 
we
 
activate
 
them,
 
it
 
sends
 
them
 
the
 
contract,
 
all
 
the
 
payment
 
processing
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
through
 
Stripe,
 
which
 
connects
 
into
 
GoHighLevel.
 
So
 
basically,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
build
 
out
 
an
 
agency
 
account
 
within
 
GoHighLevel
 
for
 
our
 
customers,
 
right?
 
 
@49:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
maybe
 
there's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
more
 
efficient
 
way
 
to
 
do
 
it,
 
I'll
 
ask
 
my
 
coach.
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
GoHighLevel
 
with
 
a
 
Stripe
 
integration
 
for
 
everything.
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
set
 
up
 
an
 
automation
 
that
 
if
 
like,
 
for
 
example,
 
some
 
people
 
get
 
deposits,
 
we
 
can
 
take
 
the
 
deposits,
 
we
 
can
 
have
 
an
 
automation
 
taking
 
the
 
deposits
 
from
 
their
 
Stripe
 
to
 
our
 
Stripe
 
weekly,
 
like
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
automatic.
 
 
@49:53
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
customers,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
doctor's
 
offices
 
and
 
doctors
 
aren't
 
going
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
Stripe
 
account.
 
 
@49:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
much.
 
It's
 
a
 
great
 
one.
 
It
 
takes,
 
I
 
believe,
 
day
 
or
 
two
 
at
 
max.
 
 
@50:04
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
you're
 
talking
 
about
 
when
 
they
 
take
 
the
 
deposit
 
for
 
the
 
patients?
 
 
@50:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
 
@50:10
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
we'll
 
definitely
 
need
 
to
 
make
 
them
 
a
 
Stripe
 
account.
 
 
@50:13
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
difficult.
 
 
@50:14
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
It's
 
very
 
simple.
 
Very
 
simple.
 
 
@50:18
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
100%.
 
 
@50:19
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
We
 
create
 
their,
 
the
 
customers
 
go
 
high-level
 
account,
 
yeah,
 
we'll
 
have
 
to
 
sign
 
them
 
up
 
for
 
Stripe
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
take
 
the
 
patient
 
deposits
 
and
 
everything's
 
run
 
through
 
their
 
account.
 
 
@50:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
 
@50:34
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
 
@50:34
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
of
 
course.
 
Yeah,
 
we
 
need
 
to.
 
It's
 
not,
 
it's
 
also
 
not
 
very
 
legal.
 
 
@50:38
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
It's
 
not,
 
you
 
should
 
not
 
do
 
that
 
legally.
 
 
@50:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
You
 
cannot
 
take,
 
like,
 
use
 
one
 
Stripe
 
account
 
to
 
take
 
all
 
the
 
deposits
 
from
 
all
 
the
 
patients.
 
It's
 
not,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
through
 
the
 
doctor's
 
office
 
Stripe.-hmm.
 
Yeah.
 
And
 
then
 
we
 
funnel
 
it
 
through,
 
like,
 
we
 
funnel
 
it
 
through
 
their
 
Stripe.
 
get
 
deposits
 
to
 
our
 
Stripe.
 
So.
 
Yeah,
 
does
 
that
 
make
 
sense?
 
 
@51:01
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
You're
 
talking
 
about
 
their
 
monthly
 
or
 
their
 
initial
 
setup
 
fee
 
and
 
then
 
their
 
monthly
 
fee?
 
 
@51:09
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
I
 
mean,
 
if
 
there's,
 
for
 
example,
 
a
 
ketamine
 
clinic
 
that
 
takes
 
a
 
$29
 
deposit
 
for
 
every
 
consultation,
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
deposit
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
a
 
retainer.
 
Yeah,
 
but
 
when
 
you
 
say
 
we
 
take
 
it,
 
I
 
mean
 
you're
 
just
 
saying…
 
The
 
deposit
 
that
 
patients
 
pay,
 
the
 
deposit
 
that
 
patients
 
pay
 
for
 
the
 
consultation
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
us.
 
For
 
example,
 
they
 
book
 
a
 
$29
 
consultation
 
to
 
patients,
 
that
 
deposit
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
us.
 
 
@51:39
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Okay.
 
Why
 
is
 
that?
 
Why
 
wouldn't
 
it
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
doctors?
 
 
@51:47
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Basically,
 
I
 
don't
 
know,
 
it's
 
just
 
a
 
model
 
that
 
my
 
coaches
 
use
 
and
 
works
 
phenomenal.
 
So,
 
if
 
we
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
we
 
don't
 
have
 
to,
 
though.
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
the
 
thing.
 
Do
 
you
 
think
 
that
 
they're
 
paying
 
too
 
much
 
money
 
already
 
in
 
that
 
table?
 
 
@52:01
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
get
 
that.
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
Okay.
 
Well,
 
again,
 
med
 
spas
 
and
 
stuff
 
like
 
that
 
are
 
totally
 
different
 
than
 
mental
 
health.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
model
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
well.
 
 
@52:11
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Okay.
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
You
 
know
 
better
 
than
 
me
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that.
 
 
@52:14
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
We'll
 
have
 
to
 
jump
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
Sarah
 
to
 
talk
 
a
 
bit,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
so.
 
 
@52:17
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
I
 
don't
 
think.
 
Okay.
 
 
@52:21
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Because,
 
you
 
these
 
patients
 
already
 
have
 
depression.
 
They
 
have
 
major
 
anxiety.
 
 
@52:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
They
 
freak
 
out
 
about
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Okay.
 
That
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@52:32
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Okay.
 
When
 
you're
 
getting
 
facelifts,
 
know,
 
jobs,
 
you
 
know.
 
 
@52:37
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I'm
 
saying
 
because
 
this
 
Alpha
 
Omega
 
guy
 
is
 
charging
 
like
 
a
 
$21
 
consultation.
 
And
 
it
 
works.
 
I
 
guess
 
it
 
works.
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
So
 
I
 
know.
 
 
@52:47
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Well,
 
maybe
 
strictly
 
for
 
ketamine.
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
Again,
 
we
 
can
 
try
 
it.
 
 
@52:53
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
That
 
also
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
thought
 
about.
 
That's
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
thought
 
about
 
too.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
All
 
right.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
that
 
settled.
 
We're
 
also
 
going
 
to
 
look
 
into
 
that
 
like
 
when
 
things
 
happen.
 
It's
 
not
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
thing
 
to
 
stall
 
about.
 
So
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
things
 
that
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
the
 
automations
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
my
 
bank
 
account
 
approved.
 
Hopefully
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
happen
 
today
 
or
 
tomorrow.
 
Then
 
after
 
that,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
Stripe
 
account.
 
 
@53:26
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
because
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
a
 
really
 
good
 
idea
 
of
 
like,
 
again,
 
when
 
the
 
monthly
 
deposits
 
come
 
in,
 
they'll
 
just
 
be
 
an
 
automation
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
month
 
or
 
whatever
 
on
 
it
 
getting
 
divided
 
up
 
or
 
whatever.
 
 
@53:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay.
 
 
@53:41
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
possible.
 
The
 
you're
 
protected,
 
everyone's
 
protected,
 
it's
 
automated.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
makes
 
sense.
 
 
@53:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm-hmm.
 
Okay.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
me?
 
So
 
I'll
 
wait
 
on
 
my
 
end
 
between
 
like
 
me
 
and
 
you,
 
me
 
and
 
your
 
clinic.
 
Do
 
you...
 
Do
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
wait
 
on
 
sending
 
you
 
the
 
Stripe
 
link,
 
or
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
try
 
it
 
with
 
my
 
payment
 
processor,
 
too?
 
Like,
 
what
 
do
 
you
 
feel
 
most
 
comfortable
 
about?
 
 
@54:09
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Can
 
I
 
send
 
it
 
through,
 
like,
 
Chase
 
Bank
 
in
 
my

If
 
you,
 
yeah,
 
actually,
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do,
 
like,
 
a
 
wire
 
transfer,
 
that's
 
possible,
 
too.
 
 
@54:19
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Well,
 
wires
 
usually
 
charge
 
you
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
money.

Oriel

Oh.
 
So,
 
Chase,
 
I
 
actually
 
don't,
 
yeah,
 
okay,
 
so
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
my
 
bank
 
account
 
approved,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
can
 
give
 
you,
 
like,
 
the,
 
hmm,
 
what
 
do
 
say?
 
 
@54:33
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Have
 
you
 
ever
 
heard
 
of
 
Zelle,
 
Z-E-L-L-E?
 
 
@54:36

Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
don't
 
think
 
we
 
have
 
that
 
in
 
Israel,
 
actually.
 
If
 
my,
 
hopefully,
 
my
 
bank
 
account
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
approved
 
tomorrow,
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
a
 
reason
 
why
 
not.
 
And
 
if
 
it
 
does
 
get
 
approved,
 
which
 
I
 
don't
 
see
 
why
 
not,
 
then
 
I
 
would
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
give
 
you,
 
like,
 
the
 
details
 
of
 
this
 
bank
 
account,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
have,
 
like,
 
a
 
ACH
 
transfer,
 
I
 
believe,
 
or
 
whatever
 
that
 
is.
 
So,
 
and
 
if
 
that's
 
not
 
also
 
a
 
thing,
 
we
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
Stripe
 
as
 
well.
 
When
 
I
 
get
 
Stripe
 
approved,
 
so
 
yeah.
 
 
@55:04

Chris
 
Shepard
 
What
 
about,
 
what
 
bank
 
are
 
you
 
by
 
the
 
way?
 
 
@55:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
1-0,
 
that's
 
an
 
Israeli
 
bank.
 
For
 
the
 
US
 
though,
 
it's
 
Mercury,
 
that's
 
their
 
name.
 
Okay,
 
you
 
haven't
 
heard
 
of
 
them?
 
Yeah,
 
they're
 
mainly
 
for
 
people
 
that
 
are
 
outside
 
the
 
US.
 
Okay.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
why
 
I
 
applied
 
to
 
them.
 
You
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
physically
 
to
 
the
 
US
 
and
 
open
 
up
 
a
 
bank
 
account
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
Which
 
I
 
probably
 
should
 
have
 
done
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
in
 
the
 
US,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
But
 
yeah,
 
so
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
 
@55:31
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Cool.
 
 
@55:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome,
 
man.
 
No
 
problem.
 
So
 
I'll
 
update
 
you
 
on
 
the
 
bank
 
account
 
details
 
once
 
it's
 
ready.
 
We're
 
going
 
to
 
figure
 
that
 
out,
 
the
 
payment
 
stuff.
 
I'll
 
update
 
you
 
when
 
the
 
campaigns
 
go
 
live.
 
Once
 
the
 
campaigns
 
go
 
live,
 
that's
 
where
 
the
 
retainer
 
or
 
whatever
 
we
 
decide.
 
Like
 
we
 
have
 
this
 
first
 
month,
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
month.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
figure
 
something
 
out
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that.
 
So
 
the
 
retainer
 
cycle
 
starts
 
from
 
the
 
moment
 
that
 
the
 
campaigns
 
go
 
live.
 
We'll
 
time
 
We're
 
So,
 
for
 
example,
 
they
 
go
 
live
 
on
 
the
 
15th.
 
A
 
month
 
after
 
that,
 
that's
 
like
 
the
 
next
 
retainer.
 
 
@56:05
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
that's
 
basically
 
about
 
that.
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that?
 
No,
 
I
 
mean,
 
once
 
we
 
build
 
it
 
up
 
and
 
running,
 
I
 
just
 
thought
 
like,
 
after
 
we
 
really
 
build
 
this
 
out,
 
we've
 
got
 
20
 
accounts.
 
Like,
 
Sarah
 
and
 
I
 
account,
 
we
 
shouldn't
 
be
 
charged.
 
 
@56:22
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
A
 
hundred
 
percent,
 
that's
 
not
 
problem.
 
 
@56:24
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
you
 
money
 
because
 
you're
 
putting
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
work.
 
I
 
mean,
 
we're
 
just
 
getting
 
this
 
going.
 
Like,
 
absolutely.
 
Yeah,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
 
@56:30
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
agree
 
with
 
you.
 
Of
 
course.
 
Yeah,
 
we're
 
partners.
 
I'm
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
charge
 
you
 
for
 
running
 
ads.
 
 
@56:38
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
And
 
if
 
you
 
need
 
more
 
money
 
or
 
whatever,
 
dude,
 
I
 
got
 
you.
 
 
@56:41
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So,
 
awesome.
 
And
 
I
 
appreciate
 
that
 
so
 
much.
 
 
@56:44
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Thank
 
you.
 
If
 
need,
 
like,
 
more
 
money
 
for
 
next
 
month,
 
whatever,
 
like,
 
just
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
 
@56:49
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
Like,
 
I
 
mean,
 
once
 
we
 
get
 
the
 
accounts
 
rolling,
 
I
 
have
 
like
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
pay
 
me
 
too.
 
I
 
need
 
to,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
some
 
more
 
cash
 
flow,
 
you
 
know,
 
to
 
invest
 
back
 
more
 
money,
 
more
 
ads,
 
more
 
content,
 
like,
 
you
 
know,
 
build
 
stuff
 
out.
 
And,
 
you
 
know,
 
if
 
I
 
do,
 
like,
 
in
 
Israel
 
terms,
 
I
 
could
 
technically,
 
you
 
know,
 
technically
 
in
 
Israel,
 
I
 
could
 
invest,
 
like,
 
20,
 
30
 
hours
 
in
 
getting
 
clients
 
in
 
Israel
 
that
 
would
 
pay
 
me
 
no
 
matter,
 
like,
 
no
 
matter
 
what,
 
because
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
name
 
already.
 
But
 
here
 
I'm,
 
like,
 
building
 
something
 
else.
 
So
 
if
 
the
 
compensation
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
lower,
 
I
 
don't
 
care.
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
some
 
cash
 
flow
 
as
 
well,
 
you
 
know.
 
So
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
update
 
you
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
that.
 
And,
 
yeah,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
I'll
 
just
 
tell
 
you.
 
I'll
 
let
 
you
 
know
 
when
 
the
 
whole
 
thing
 
is
 
ready.
 
Like,
 
when
 
the
 
whole
 
landing
 
page
 
is
 
ready,
 
automations,
 
ads,
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
And
 
do
 
I
 
have
 
an
 
approval
 
to
 
pump
 
the
 
ad
 
budget
 
to
 
$100
 
once
 
it's
 
all
 
ready?
 
 
@57:39
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
go
 
ahead.
 
 
@57:40
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
 
@57:40
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
No
 
problem.
 
I'll
 
try
 
it
 
for,
 
like,
 
five
 
or
 
seven
 
days
 
at
 
$100
 
just
 
to
 
get
 
–
 
it'll
 
learn
 
a
 
lot
 
faster.
 
 
@57:46
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
100%.
 
I
 
like
 
that
 
mindset,
 
too.
 
Awesome.
 
So
 
I'll
 
update
 
you.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
any
 
questions,
 
let
 
me
 
know.
 
Anything
 
else
 
just,
 
you
 
know,
 
send
 
me
 
as
 
usual,
 
like,
 
resources
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
that
 
you
 
find.
 
 
@57:57
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
Let's
 
jump
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
tomorrow
 
morning
 
with
 
Sarah.
 
 
@57:59
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Mm
 
Sounds
 
good.
 
 
@58:02
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I'll
 
shoot
 
you
 
a
 
text
 
on
 
times,
 
and
 
yeah,
 
I'm
 
available
 
if
 
anything
 
pops
 
up
 
today
 
when
 
you're
 
going
 
through
 
stuff.
 
 
@58:08
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
I'm
 
just
 
working
 
on
 
a
 
bunch
 
of
 
patient
 
stuff.
 
That's
 
cool.
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
 
@58:13
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Also,
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
didn't
 
tell
 
you.
 
 
@58:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
The
 
same
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
didn't
 
tell
 
you.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
first?
 
 
@58:18
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
making
 
sure
 
I
 
had
 
my
 
list
 
of
 
to-dos.
 
Is
 
there
 
anything
 
else
 
that
 
I
 
needed
 
to
 
get
 
done?
 
 
@58:28
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Get
 
pictures
 
of
 
Dr.
 
Singla
 
in
 
the
 
office
 
if
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
go
 
there
 
today.
 
If
 
you
 
can,
 
just
 
have
 
a
 
clarity
 
for
 
yourself
 
if
 
there's
 
patients
 
in
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
film
 
testimonials
 
for,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
that
 
locked
 
and
 
loaded,
 
and
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
have
 
a
 
filming
 
and
 
shooting
 
day.
 
Another
 
thing,
 
I'm
 
going
 
to
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
ad
 
scripts.
 
Be
 
ready
 
on
 
me
 
sending
 
you
 
ad
 
scripts
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
film
 
in
 
the
 
clinic
 
itself
 
too.
 
 
@58:54
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
could
 
shoot
 
probably
 
next
 
week.
 
 
@58:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Okay,
 
yeah.
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
ads
 
running
 
now.
 
Also,
 
it's
 
So
 
it's
 
better
 
to
 
run
 
these
 
ads
 
first,
 
see
 
which
 
ones
 
work
 
best,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
just
 
can
 
convert
 
that
 
to
 
video.
 
 
@59:09
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
That's
 
going
 
to
 
work
 
way
 
better,
 
you
 
know?
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
remember
 
doing
 
this,
 
but
 
someone
 
–
 
I
 
thought
 
there
 
were
 
some
 
tips
 
and
 
tricks
 
on
 
filming
 
for
 
Haygen.
 
Like,
 
they
 
wanted
 
you
 
to
 
talk
 
a
 
certain
 
way.
 
They
 
wanted
 
you
 
to,
 
like,
 
move
 
your
 
head.
 
Like,
 
did
 
you
 
ever
 
come
 
across
 
anything
 
like
 
that?
 
 
@59:32
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
No,
 
but
 
I'm
 
pretty
 
sure
 
that
 
when
 
you
 
–
 
if
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
team
 
plan,
 
I
 
think
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
have,
 
like,
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
you.
 
can
 
contact
 
their
 
support.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
whole,
 
I
 
believe,
 
university
 
of
 
that.
 
Like,
 
there's
 
no
 
way
 
that
 
they
 
don't.
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
extremely
 
simple.
 
There's
 
also,
 
I
 
believe,
 
tutorials
 
online,
 
but
 
I
 
believe
 
that
 
Haygen,
 
the
 
company,
 
should
 
give
 
you,
 
like,
 
the
 
proper,
 
proper,
 
like,
 
instructions
 
to
 
get
 
good
 
videos
 
going.
 
Because
 
if
 
they
 
–
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
get
 
good
 
videos,
 
they
 
don't
 
have
 
attention.
 
So,
 
yeah.
 
So
 
write
 
that
 
down,
 
too.
 
Anything
 
else
 
that
 
I
 
forgot?
 
 
@1:00:01
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
No,
 
I
 
can't
 
think
 
of
 
anything
 
right
 
now.
 
 
@1:00:03
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Awesome.
 
Okay.
 
And
 
one
 
last
 
thing
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
tell
 
you,
 
which
 
is
 
insane,
 
which
 
is
 
insane.
 
I
 
went
 
on
 
a
 
call.
 
I
 
went
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
yesterday
 
with
 
the
 
first
 
ever
 
person
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
to
 
beat
 
the
 
government
 
in
 
a
 
federal
 
court
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
psilocybin
 
treatments.
 
So
 
what
 
he
 
did,
 
he
 
has
 
an
 
organization
 
now
 
that
 
is
 
basically
 
classified
 
under
 
religious
 
ceremonies.
 
And
 
what
 
he
 
can
 
do,
 
basically,
 
because
 
of
 
that,
 
he
 
can
 
treat
 
psilocybin
 
legally.
 
And
 
remember
 
the
 
guy
 
who
 
told
 
you
 
from
 
Utah?
 
He
 
can
 
treat
 
people
 
legally
 
with
 
psilocybin.
 
And
 
not
 
only
 
that,
 
because
 
his
 
organization
 
now
 
is
 
legal
 
by
 
federal
 
court,
 
he
 
can
 
train
 
clinicians
 
under
 
him
 
throughout
 
the
 
whole
 
U.S.
 
and
 
give
 
them
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
treat
 
people
 
with
 
psilocybin.
 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
 
That's
 
insane.
 
That's
 
crazy.
 
 
@1:01:04
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
might
 
have
 
to
 
jump
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
and
 
meet
 
this
 
guy.
 
 
@1:01:07
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
It's
 
insane.
 
Insane.
 
Like,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
that.
 
I
 
was
 
boggled.
 
 
@1:01:14
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
at
 
our
 
clinic.
 
 
@1:01:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
so
 
he's
 
working
 
right
 
now.
 
had
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
him
 
yesterday.
 
We
 
agreed
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
in
 
like
 
two,
 
three
 
days.
 
 
@1:01:22
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
all
 
his
 
resources
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
 
@1:01:25
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
He
 
wants
 
to
 
promote
 
a
 
course.
 
wants
 
to
 
start
 
like
 
a
 
training
 
program
 
for
 
clinicians
 
to
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
practice.
 
 
@1:01:30
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
 
@1:01:31
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
yeah,
 
there's
 
a
 
lot.
 
There's
 
like
 
crazy
 
things
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
coming
 
on
 
the
 
way.
 
 
@1:01:36
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
we
 
could
 
probably
 
help
 
him
 
too.
 
Again,
 
like
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
talking
 
to
 
all
 
these
 
practices
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
can
 
say,
 
hey,
 
also
 
we
 
have
 
an
 
add
 
on
 
course
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
bring
 
on
 
psilocybin
 
like
 
me.
 
Like
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
bring
 
on
 
this,
 
this
 
treatment
 
program
 
to
 
my
 
clinic
 
with
 
psilocybin.
 
So
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
learn
 
from
 
this
 
guy.
 
 
@1:01:56
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
definitely
 
possible.
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
problem.
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
see,
 
I
 
don't
 
know.
 
When
 
he
 
starts
 
the
 
course
 
though,
 
that's
 
the
 
thing.
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
him,
 
get
 
more
 
details
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
too.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
I
 
watched,
 
he
 
has
 
like
 
a
 
webinar
 
on
 
his
 
website.
 
I
 
watched
 
that.
 
He
 
has
 
like
 
a
 
good
 
direction,
 
but
 
he
 
needs
 
more,
 
needs
 
more
 
polishing.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
like,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
help
 
him
 
a
 
lot
 
with
 
polishing,
 
like
 
the
 
messaging
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
 
@1:02:19
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
So
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
on
 
my
 
clinical
 
end.
 
I
 
mean,
 
I
 
run,
 
is
 
he
 
a
 
doctor?
 
 
@1:02:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
I
 
actually,
 
I
 
didn't
 
ask
 
him.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
why,
 
but
 
he's
 
an
 
MD.
 
 
@1:02:30
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah.
 
Tell
 
him
 
about
 
me
 
and
 
my
 
clinic.
 
Cause
 
I
 
can,
 
we
 
can
 
help
 
mold
 
this
 
for
 
him.
 
 
@1:02:38
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
let's
 
see.
 
You
 
mean
 
like
 
offering
 
like
 
the
 
TMS
 
clinics
 
to
 
input
 
that
 
too?
 
 
@1:02:47
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Well,
 
no,
 
I'm
 
more
 
of
 
like,
 
again,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
bring
 
in
 
if
 
it,
 
cause
 
I
 
have
 
patients
 
that
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
treat
 
with
 
psilocybin.
 
Uh
 
huh.
 
We
 
can
 
like
 
beta
 
test.
 
Like
 
rolling
 
out
 
his
 
program
 
to
 
clinics
 
like
 
mine,
 
get
 
it
 
going
 
in
 
my
 
clinic,
 
prove
 
the
 
concept,
 
and
 
then
 
we
 
actually
 
will
 
help
 
other
 
clinics
 
get
 
psilocybin
 
as
 
well.
 
 
@1:03:16
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Like
 
a
 
partner
 
with
 
him.
 
Yeah,
 
that
 
sounds
 
good.
 
 
@1:03:21
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
I'll
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
him.
 
I'll
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
you
 
said.
 
 
@1:03:23
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
See
 
what
 
he
 
says
 
about
 
that
 
too.
 
 
@1:03:25
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Tell
 
him
 
I'm
 
the
 
clinical
 
director
 
at
 
BrainStim
 
TMS.
 
We
 
have
 
patients
 
that
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
treat
 
with
 
psilocybin.
 
I'm
 
very
 
interested
 
in
 
meeting
 
and
 
talking
 
to
 
him
 
about
 
this
 
whole
 
process.
 
 
@1:03:36
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
That's
 
awesome.
 
Okay,
 
no
 
problem.
 
I'm
 
supposed
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
him
 
on
 
Friday,
 
I
 
believe,
 
depending
 
on
 
his
 
availability.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
I
 
mean,
 
that's
 
like
 
a
 
very
 
big
 
thing
 
that
 
could
 
happen
 
now.
 
A
 
huge
 
thing.
 
Like
 
not
 
even
 
huge.
 
That's
 
like
 
revolution
 
type
 
.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
so
 
that's
 
about
 
that.
 
 
@1:03:59
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Just
 
want
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
that
 
too.
 
And
 
once
 
we
 
build
 
this
 
out,
 
and
 
hopefully
 
maybe
 
we
 
can
 
get
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
of
 
revenue
 
from
 
helping
 
other,
 
like
 
when
 
we
 
sign
 
up
 
10
 
clinics
 
to
 
do
 
P2P
 
marketing,
 
or
 
our
 
marketing,
 
whatever,
 
we
 
can
 
say,
 
hey,
 
doctor,
 
not
 
only
 
do
 
do
 
it
 
with
 
TMS,
 
but
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
have
 
psilocybin
 
as
 
a
 
treatment
 
option
 
for
 
your
 
patients?
 
Here,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
course
 
for
 
that.
 
 
@1:04:29
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
a
 
hundred
 
percent.
 
Like,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
whole
 
training
 
program.
 
We
 
can
 
have
 
a
 
partnership
 
with
 
the
 
guy,
 
telling
 
that
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
commissions
 
based
 
on
 
people
 
that
 
we
 
give
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
program.
 
 
@1:04:38
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yeah,
 
there's
 
insane
 
stuff
 
that
 
we've
 
done
 
here.
 
Exactly.
 
We
 
get
 
a
 
commission
 
for
 
every
 
account
 
we
 
bring
 
to
 
him.
 
 
@1:04:43
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
Yeah,
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
cool.
 
It's
 
awesome.
 
Yeah,
 
it's
 
all
 
like
 
in
 
babies,
 
all
 
very,
 
very
 
fresh,
 
new,
 
nothing's
 
guaranteed.
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
see
 
this
 
guy
 
more,
 
meet
 
him
 
more,
 
know
 
him
 
more.
 
He
 
seems
 
like
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
guy.
 
Yeah.
 
But
 
so.
 
I
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
him
 
like
 
this
 
is
 
my
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
I'm
 
extremely
 
extremely
 
extremely
 
excited
 
about
 
because
 
with
 
my
 
marketing
 
knowledge,
 
and
 
my
 
understanding
 
of
 
like
 
human
 
psychology,
 
I
 
can
 
help
 
him
 
like
 
reach
 
people
 
because
 
there's
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
he
 
talks
 
in
 
which
 
it
 
applies
 
to
 
people
 
like
 
me
 
and
 
maybe
 
you
 
that
 
are
 
super
 
hyper
 
aware
 
of
 
what
 
psilocybin
 
is.
 
And
 
he
 
talks
 
about
 
like,
 
it's
 
a
 
mystical
 
experience.
 
And
 
it's
 
like
 
something
 
that's
 
like,
 
different
 
and
 
all
 
that
 
stuff.
 
But
 
he
 
doesn't.
 
It's
 
hard
 
to
 
it
 
doesn't
 
it
 
doesn't
 
do
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
job
 
at
 
like,
 
how's
 
it
 
called?
 
Yeah,
 
articulating
 
how
 
psilocybin
 
really
 
is
 
different
 
that
 
it's
 
not
 
dangerous
 
or
 
some
 
hippie
 
trippy
 
.
 
That's
 
like
 
the
 
main
 
challenge
 
here.
 
 
@1:05:45
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Yes,
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
can
 
help
 
out
 
with
 
that
 
part.
 
 
@1:05:48
 
-
 
Oriel
 
Mor
 
(oriel.mor2001@gmail.com)
 
So
 
yeah,
 
that's
 
basically
 
it.
 
So
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
update
 
you
 
when
 
I
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
this
 
guy.
 
And
 
I'll
 
talk
 
to
 
him
 
tell
 
it
 
tell
 
him
 
like
 
what
 
we
 
talked
 
about.
 
And
 
all
 
that
 
stuff
 
too.
 
So
 
yeah,
 
he's
 
a
 
very
 
he's
 
a
 
very
 
great
 
guy.
 
He's
 
a
 
guy.
 
So.
 
 
@1:06:02
 
-
 
Chris
 
Shepard
 
Okay,
