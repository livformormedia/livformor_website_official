# Direct Response Copywriting Skill
## For LivForMor Media — Ketamine, TMS & Spravato Clinic Marketing

---

## PART 1: THE MISSION & VOICE

### Who You Are Writing For
This copy is always written by **Oriel Mor**, founder of LivForMor Media. The audience is **cash-pay ketamine, TMS, and Spravato clinic owners** who are either:
- Struggling to make marketing work despite investing in agencies
- Running clinics they believe in but can't fill
- Open to a performance-based model where they only pay when patients show up

### The Mission
> "Help 100,000 people beat treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD — when everything else has failed."

This is not a business tagline. It is the operational north star. Every piece of copy must serve it. When clinics grow, they reach more patients. When more patients are reached, the 100,000 becomes real.

### Oriel's Voice Characteristics
- **Direct and confident** — never hedging, never vague
- **Emotionally grounded** — not manipulative, but unafraid to name feelings plainly
- **Data-precise** — uses specific numbers (MIT: 5-minute window, 80% drop; 7 touches; $190 intro offer)
- **Mission-driven** — regularly ties marketing back to patient outcomes, not just revenue
- **Anti-agency-speak** — never says "leverage synergies" or "optimize touchpoints"; says "call them back within 5 minutes" and "send them this exact text"
- **Conversational authority** — talks like a peer who has seen the data, not a salesperson

## PART 2: THE DIRECT RESPONSE MASTERS — CORE PRINCIPLES

### Eugene Schwartz — The Market Sophistication Framework

**The 5 Stages of Awareness (most important concept in copywriting):**
1. **Unaware** — doesn't know they have a problem (rare for this clinic audience)
2. **Problem Aware** — knows they're suffering but doesn't know solutions exist (most ketamine patients start here)
3. **Solution Aware** — knows treatments exist but hasn't heard of this clinic
4. **Product Aware** — knows about your clinic but hasn't committed
5. **Most Aware** — ready to buy, just needs terms/price/offer

**Application to clinic copy:**
- Patient ads should start at stage 2: "You've tried everything..." (assumes they know they're suffering)
- Clinic owner ads should start at stage 3: "You know marketing works for other clinics..." (assumes they know agencies exist but have failed them)
- Retargeting should speak to stage 4 or 5: remove friction, confirm the decision

**Market Sophistication:**
- The more sophisticated the market, the more specific your claims must be
- Ketamine patients are sophisticated — they've researched. Don't explain what ketamine is. Explain WHY it works differently when SSRIs don't.
- Clinic owners are sophisticated — they've been burned by agencies. Don't pitch services. Show you understand their specific failures.

**The Mechanism:**
The unique HOW behind your claim. Instead of "ketamine therapy for depression," the mechanism is: "Ketamine triggers rapid synaptic growth in the prefrontal cortex — bypassing the serotonin pathway that SSRIs target. That's why it works for people SSRIs don't."

Always name the mechanism. It creates differentiation that competitors who just say "FDA-approved" cannot copy.

### Gary Halbert — The Engagement Rules

**Never be boring.** If the first sentence doesn't pull them into the second sentence, the copy is dead. Every sentence earns the right to the next.

**The conversational paragraph rule:**
- No paragraph longer than 3–4 sentences for video scripts
- No paragraph longer than 5 sentences for written copy
- Use incomplete sentences for rhythm: "And that's the problem."

**Write how you speak** — but more deliberately. Read all copy aloud. If it sounds like someone talking, it's working. If it sounds like a brochure, it's failing.

**Specificity kills skepticism.** Never write "many clinic owners." Write "43 clinic owners I spoke to." Never write "studies show." Write "MIT research: you have a 5-minute window."

**The A-pile vs B-pile rule:**
Imagine your copy landing in someone's inbox, social feed, or on their screen. It has one job: land in the A-pile (things they actually read) rather than the B-pile (things they scroll past in 0.2 seconds). The hook is the only thing that determines which pile you're in.

**Halbert's hook tests:**
1. Does it name who it's for immediately?
2. Does it make a claim so specific they can't help but wonder if it's true?
3. Does it create a gap — something they suddenly need to close?

---

### Gary Bencivenga — The Persuasion Ethics Framework

**Persuasion is not manipulation.** The goal is to help prospects understand, clearly and compellingly, why what you offer can genuinely solve their real problem. Manipulation hides the truth. Persuasion reveals it.

**Proof is the most important element in copy:**
- Third-party validation (MIT research, clinical studies) > self-claims
- Specifics (80% drop after 5 minutes) > vague statements (you should call faster)
- Mechanism (synaptic growth, NMDA receptor) > marketing language (breakthrough treatment)

**The emotional underbelly principle:**
Every purchasing decision — including a clinic owner deciding to hire a marketing firm — is made emotionally and justified rationally afterward. Your copy must first move them, then give them the logical framework to justify the decision they already made emotionally.

For clinic owners: Their emotional fear is being burned again. Their emotional desire is to feel like they're doing enough for their patients. Lead with these. Then give them data.

For patients: Their emotional state is exhaustion and cautious hope. Their fear is investing more time and money in something that won't work. They want to feel seen before they feel sold.

**Empathy architecture:**
1. Name the suffering precisely
2. Validate that they've tried reasonable things
3. Introduce the reason those things failed (mechanism)
4. Offer a different path with proof
5. Give a specific first step

## PART 3: THE ICP — WHO THIS IS AND ISN'T FOR

### The Exact Buyer
Two types of clinic owners. Not "mental health clinics." Not "medical practices." Specifically:

| ICP Type | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Cash-pay ketamine clinic** | IV infusion, IM, oral lozenges |
| **Esketamine/TMS clinic** | Spravato (esketamine nasal spray), TMS therapy |

Often: clinics running both modalities.

### The ICP Is NOT Broke — This Is The Most Important Filter

Every piece of copy must self-select for clinic owners who are:
- Running a real business that needs more patients (not someone testing if the model works)
- Prepared to spend real ad budget — **minimum $100/day**
- Have or will get **LegitScript certification** (required to run ketamine/Spravato ads on Google and Meta)
- **Willing to be on video** — face on camera, TikTok, Reels, YouTube, regularly

### The Pre-Qualification Checklist (Embed in Every Offer Ad)

These three requirements must appear — naturally, not as a formal list — in every Direct Offer Ad. Their purpose is dual: (1) pre-qualify the right buyer and (2) repel the wrong one.

| Requirement | Language to Use In Script |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| $100/day ad spend | "at least $100 a day in ad budget" / "real volume, not $500/month tests" |
| LegitScript certification | "LegitScript certification" / "without it your account gets suspended" |
| On video | "willing to be on camera" / "your face on TikTok, Reels, YouTube" / "stock photos don't build trust, faces do" |

### Why Pre-Qualifying In The Ad Is a Selling Mechanism (Not a Filter)

Naming requirements in ad copy does NOT reduce your audience — it increases intent.

- A clinic owner who sees "$100/day in ad spend" and thinks *"that's me"* — leans in harder
- A clinic owner who sees that and thinks *"I can't do that"* — self-selects out

Both are wins. This is the Schwartz mechanism applied to B2B: specificity acts as a magnet for the right buyer and a signal to the wrong one that this isn't for them. Generic ads get generic leads. Specific pre-qualifying copy gets buyers.

**Rule:** If you are writing any Direct Offer Ad and the three requirements are not in the body — rewrite the body.

## PART 4: THE LIVFORMOR CLINIC FRAMEWORKS

### The 4-Question Marketing Audit
Use this as the spine of any educational or offer-based content aimed at clinic owners:

1. **What type of ads are you running?** Psychology/stories/testimonials vs. clinical claims ("FDA-approved")
2. **What medium are you using?** Video + face on camera vs. stock images
3. **How fast do you call your leads?** Within 5 minutes vs. hours/days later (MIT: 80% drop after 5 min)
4. **Do you have an intro offer?** $190 first session vs. full price right away

### The 3 Root Causes of Clinic Marketing Failure
1. **No dedicated landing page** — sending traffic to homepage with navigation links (every extra link kills conversion)
2. **Broken speed to lead** — not responding within 5 minutes (MIT research: 80% drop in lead qualification odds)
3. **Insufficient follow-up** — stopping at 1–2 touches instead of 7 minimum

### The Performance Model (unique differentiator)
- **$99 per qualified inquiry** — no retainer, no monthly fee, no contract
- A **qualified inquiry** is defined together with the clinic before launch: cash-pay, first contact with the practice, pre-screened by our team, consented to be contacted
- The definition is set by the clinic — if the inquiry doesn't meet the agreed standard, there is no charge
- One clinic per market — exclusivity guarantee
- **Legally structured as marketing service fees** (advertising services rendered), not as referral fees or per-patient payments

### The $190 Intro Offer Framework
- Standard ketamine series: $4,000–$8,000. Spravato: $6,000–$20,000. TMS: $3,000–$6,000.
- Charging $190 for the first session lowers the barrier to the first "yes"
- The treatment sells itself — let them experience it
- Once they've experienced it, selling the full series is dramatically easier
- First session ROI math: $190 cost to acquire a patient worth $4,000–$20,000

### The 5-Minute Speed-to-Lead Rule
From MIT Sloan Research:
- 5-minute window to respond before odds of qualifying a lead drop 80%
- An automated SMS within 60 seconds of form submission: "Hi, we got your message. Can we connect in the next 10 minutes?"
- People with depression need to feel seen immediately — the faster you respond, the more human you feel

### The 7-Touch Follow-Up Science
A patient saying "let me think about it" is NOT saying no. They are saying: "I'm scared and I need someone to keep showing up."
- Minimum 7 touches: call, email, SMS, in deliberate sequence
- Touch 7 script that converts: "I've reached out a few times and I don't want to bother you — but I genuinely believe this could help you. If timing isn't right, I understand. I just didn't want to stop without giving you every possible chance to say yes."

## PART 4: SCRIPT WRITING RULES

### Hook Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Always name the treatment in the hook** — "ketamine," "TMS," or "Spravato" must appear in the first 15 words of any direct offer ad
2. **Name the audience** — "ketamine and TMS clinic owners" or "If you're struggling with depression and haven't found relief" — be specific immediately
3. **Create a gap** — make them feel like they're missing something they need to know
4. **Never start with "I"** — start with the audience or the problem
5. **Max 2 sentences for a video hook** — it must be sayable in one breath

### Hook Formula for Clinic Owner Ads:
`[Audience] — [specific pain they recognize] — [surprising reframe or claim]`

Example: *"Ketamine and TMS clinic owners — if you've been burned by an agency before, this is specifically for you."*

### Hook Formula for Patient Ads:
`[Emotional mirror] — [validation of what they've tried] — [door to hope]`

Example: *"You've tried the medication. You've tried therapy. You're still here, still struggling. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you're starting to wonder if this is just how life is going to be. It doesn't have to be."*

### Body Structure for Video Scripts (60–90s)
1. **Expand the hook** — restate in slightly different language, deepen the pain or curiosity
2. **Mechanism** — the specific reason the problem exists or the solution works differently
3. **Proof** — specific number, research stat, or pattern seen across 40+ clinics
4. **Stakes** — why this matters beyond the transaction (100,000 people, lives changed)
5. **CTA** — one action, stated simply (usually: "link in bio, four questions, 60 seconds")

### CTA Rules
- One CTA per script. Always one.
- For paid ads: "Link in bio" → 4 qualifying questions → application
- For organic: "Follow for more" or "DM me your clinic name/website"
- Never be clever with the CTA — be clear

### Length Guidelines
| Format | Length |
|--------|--------|
| Short Paid Ad | 45–60s |
| Standard Ad | 60–80s |
| Founder Voice | 80–100s |
| Organic Educational | 60–75s |
| Written Ad Copy | 200–400 words |
| Email nurture | 150–300 words |

## PART 5: WRITING CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any copy, run this checklist:

**Hooks:**
- [ ] Treatment named (ketamine/TMS/Spravato) within first 15 words?
- [ ] Audience named within first 10 words?
- [ ] Does it create a gap or a mirror?
- [ ] Is it deliverable in one breath?

**Body:**
- [ ] Did emotion come before logic?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific number or research stat?
- [ ] Is the mechanism named (WHY it works differently)?
- [ ] Are paragraphs 3 sentences or fewer (for video)?
- [ ] Does it connect to the 100,000 mission at some point?

**CTA:**
- [ ] Single, clear action?
- [ ] Friction-free (one step to take)?

**Voice:**
- [ ] Read aloud — does it sound like a confident, grounded person talking?
- [ ] No agency speak ("leverage," "optimize," "seamless")?
- [ ] No vague superlatives ("best," "leading," "cutting-edge")? Use specifics instead.

## PART 7: WHAT NOT TO DO

- ❌ Never say "FDA-approved" in a hook — it triggers compliance blocks and logic, not emotion
- ❌ Never use stock phrases: "Are you struggling with depression?" as an opener — too expected, zero pattern interrupt
- ❌ Never use vague copy: "We help clinics grow" — always be specific about the mechanism and the outcome
- ❌ Never write for everyone — "ketamine and TMS clinic owners" or "people who haven't responded to antidepressants" — never both in the same script
- ❌ Never have more than one CTA — every additional ask reduces the chance they take any action
- ❌ Never use fake urgency — the mission and the real stakes create urgency organically
- ❌ Never apologize for selling — you are helping. The confidence of knowing you can help is itself persuasive.
