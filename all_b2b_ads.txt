I
 
analyzed
 
over
 
100
 
clinics
 
in
 
the
 
Ketamine,
 
TMS
 
and
 
Spravato
 
space.
 
And
 
what
 
I
 
found
 
was
 
horrifying.
 
 
 
❌
Most
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
using
 
stock
 
images,
 
the
 
same
 
“brain
 
vs
 
brain”
 
ad,
 
and
 
the
 
woman
 
smiling
 
next
 
to
 
a
 
Spravao
 
nasal
 
spray
 
picture.
 
 
❌
Most
 
of
 
them
 
have
 
zero
 
video
 
content.
 
 
❌
 
Most
 
of
 
them
 
look,
 
sound,
 
and
 
feel
 
identical.
 
 
So…
 
What
 
do
 
your
 
ads
 
look
 
like?
 
 
If
 
you’re
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
group
 
of
 
people
 
that
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
ads…
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
change
 
that.
 
 
How?
 
Start
 
using
 
video.
 
But
 
not
 
just
 
every
 
video.
 
 
A
 
video
 
of
 
you.
 
On
 
camera.
 
In
 
your
 
clinic
 
(or
 
a
 
nice
 
park,
 
that
 
also
 
works),
 
wearing
 
your
 
authoritative
 
white
 
coat.
 
 
And
 
if
 
you’re
 
thinking
 
"I'm
 
not
 
comfortable
 
on
 
camera”...
 
 
That's
 
fine.
 
But
 
here’s
 
what
 
you’re
 
missing
 
out
 
on:
 
 
 
1.
 
Real
 
Estate
 
Video
 
takes
 
up
 
more
 
space
 
in
 
the
 
feed.
 
More
 
space
 
=
 
more
 
attention.
 
 
 
2.
 
Trust
 
People
 
want
 
to
 
see
 
who
 
they're
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
working
 
with.
 
Your
 
face
 
builds
 
trust
 
faster
 
than
 
any
 
stock
 
photo
 
ever
 
will.
 
 
 
3.
 
Authority
 
When
 
you're
 
wearing
 
your
 
white
 
coat,
 
speaking
 
with
 
confidence,
 
explaining
 
how
 
this
 
works—you
 
look
 
like
 
the
 
expert
 
you
 
are.
 
 
 
4.
 
Differentiation
 
(USP)
 
Your
 
voice.
 
Your
 
clinic.
 
Your
 
approach.
 
That's
 
your
 
unique
 
selling
 
point.
 
Stock
 
photos
 
can't
 
do
 
that,
 
nobody
 
can
 
copy
 
and
 
paste
 
your
 
unique
 
videos.
 
 
 
5.
 
Authenticity
 
People
 
can
 
smell
 
fake
 
from
 
a
 
mile
 
away.
 
Real
 
video
 
=
 
real
 
connection.
 
 
 
Once
 
you
 
do
 
that?
 
 
 
 
Your
 
ads
 
stop
 
looking
 
like
 
everyone
 
else's.
 
 
People
 
stop
 
scrolling.
 
 
They
 
watch.
 
 
They
 
think:
 
"This
 
person
 
actually
 
knows
 
what
 
they're
 
talking
 
about,
 
they
 
know
 
what
 
I’m
 
going
 
through."
 
 
And
 
they
 
book.
 
 
And
 
they
 
not
 
only
 
book,
 
they
 
show
 
up.
 
 
 
So
 
here's
 
my
 
offer:
 
 
Book
 
a
 
30-minute
 
call
 
with
 
me.
 
 
I'll
 
audit
 
your
 
current
 
ads
 
for
 
free.
 
 
I'll
 
show
 
you:
 
 
-
 
What
 
kind
 
of
 
video
 
content
 
you
 
should
 
be
 
creating
 
-
 
How
 
to
 
film
 
it
 
(even
 
if
 
you
 
hate
 
being
 
on
 
camera)
 
 
And
 
if
 
we
 
work
 
together,
 
we'll
 
handle
 
all
 
the
 
editing
 
and
 
script
 
creating
 
process.
 
 
You
 
just
 
film.
 
We
 
do
 
the
 
rest.
 
 
And
 
if
 
you're
 
not
 
happy
 
after
 
45
 
days?
 
 
Full
 
refund.
 
 
(Also,
 
you'll
 
look
 
great
 
in
 
that
 
white
 
coat.
 
Trust
 
me.)
 
 
---
 
 
Look,
 
you
 
can
 
keep
 
running
 
the
 
same
 
stock
 
photos
 
as
 
everyone
 
else.
 
 
Or
 
you
 
can
 
stand
 
out.
 
 
Your
 
choice.
 
 
Click

Book
 
the
 
call.
 
Let's
 
make
 
you
 
the
 
obvious
 
choice
 
in
 
your
 
market.

how

$100K/month
 
with
 
ketamine

(spoiler:
 
he
 
uses
 
video).
 
 
P.P.S.
 
—
 
Minimum

Hook
 
1:
 
If
 
you
 
offer
 
Ketamine,
 
Spravato
 
and
 
TMS
 
and
 
your
 
agency
 
keeps
 
blaming
 
the
 
algorithm,
 
Read
 
this.
 
 
Hook
 
2:
 
How
 
to
 
finally
 
get
 
high-quality
 
leads
 
for
 
your
 
clinic,
 
without
 
hearing
 
the
 
same
 
“give
 
the
 
algorithm
 
time”
 
excuses.
 
 
 
Hook
 
3:
 
If
 
you
 
offer
 
Ketamine,
 
Spravato
 
or
 
TMS,
 
have
 
you
 
ever
 
stopped
 
for
 
a
 
second
 
and
 
asked
 
yourself:
 
 
 
If
 
you
 
offer
 
Ketamine,
 
Spravato
 
or
 
TMS,
 
have
 
you
 
ever
 
stopped
 
for
 
a
 
second
 
and
 
asked
 
yourself:
 
 
 
Have
 
you
 
ever
 
stopped
 
for
 
a
 
second
 
and
 
asked
 
yourself:
 
 
 
“What
 
does
 
my
 
agency
 
actually
 
track?”
 
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
your
 
numbers?
 
 
Your
 
cost
 
per
 
new
 
patient
 
in
 
the
 
chair?
 
 
Not
 
cost
 
per
 
lead.
 
Not
 
cost
 
per
 
click.
 
Not
 
"engagement
 
rate."
 
 
Cost
 
per
 
actual
 
patient.
 
 
Do
 
they
 
include
 
their
 
marketing
 
fee
 
in
 
the
 
expenses
 
when
 
they
 
calculate
 
it?
 
 
(Spoiler:
 
they
 
probably
 
don't.)
 
 
Here's
 
the
 
thing
 
that
 
you
 
already
 
know:
 
 
Leads
 
don't
 
pay
 
your
 
bills.
 
 
Patients
 
do.
 
 
So
 
let
 
me
 
ask
 
you:
 
 
Do
 
you
 
know
 
your
 
cost
 
per
 
acquiring
 
a
 
new
 
patient?
 
 
If
 
the
 
answer
 
is
 
"no"
 
or
 
"I
 
think
 
it's
 
around…"
 
We
 
should
 
talk.
 
 
Because
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
that
 
number
 
in
 
about
 
10
 
minutes.
 
 
And
 
more
 
importantly,
 
I
 
can
 
tell
 
you
 
where
 
you're
 
losing
 
money
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
fix
 
it.
 
 
My
 
name
 
is
 
Oriel
 
Mor.
 
 
Since
 
2021,
 
I’ve
 
managed
 
over
 
$1,000,000
 
in
 
ad
 
campaigns
 
across
 
63
 
industries
 
($500K
 
of
 
it
 
this
 
year
 
alone).
 
 
And
 
here’s
 
my
 
simple
 
offer
 
to
 
you:
 
 
Book
 
a
 
30-minute
 
call
 
with
 
me.
 
 
I'll
 
audit
 
your
 
marketing
 
at
 
no
 
cost.
 
 
I'll
 
show
 
you:
 
 
Your
 
actual
 
cost
 
per
 
patient
 
 
How
 
you're
 
losing
 
potential
 
patients
 
(and
 
money)
 
The
 
2-3
 
things
 
you
 
can
 
fix
 
this
 
week
 
to
 
improve
 
it
 
 
To
 
be
 
clear,
 
my
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
sell
 
you
 
our
 
marketing
 
services.
 
 
 
But
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
practical
 
value
 
and
 
insights
 
before
 
we
 
get
 
to
 
that
 
level.
 
 
And
 
if
 
we
 
do
 
decide
 
to
 
work
 
together?
 
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
simple
 
guarantee:
 
work
 
with
 
us
 
for
 
45
 
days.
 
 
 
If
 
you’re
 
not
 
happy
 
with
 
us
 
for
 
any
 
reason
 
(results,
 
communication,
 
or
 
even
 
my
 
voice,
 
which
 
is
 
very
 
pleasant
 
by
 
the
 
way)
 
 
You’ll
 
get
 
a
 
full
 
refund.
 
 
 
That
 
being
 
said,
 
we
 
are
 
not
 
cheap.
 
 
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
have
 
an
 
active
 
clinic
 
and
 
a
 
budget
 
(minimum
 
$3000),
 
we
 
won’t
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
fit.
 
 
The
 
next
 
step
 
is
 
to
 
click
 
below
 
and
 
leave
 
your
 
details.
 
 
🔴
 
Super
 
important:
 
After
 
you
 
submit
 
your
 
details,
 
you’ll
 
get
 
a
 
link
 
to
 
my
 
personal
 
calendar
 
to
 
book
 
a
 
call
 
with
 
me.
 
 
 
Make
 
sure
 
to
 
take
 
30
 
seconds
 
to
 
book
 
your
 
call.
 
 
P.S.
 
—
 
If
 
you
 
book
 
within
 
48
 
hours,
 
I'll
 
send
 
you
 
a
 
free
 
breakdown
 
of
 
how
 
a
 
random
 
doctor
 
is
 
making
 
$100K/month
 
with
 
ketamine
 
treatments.
 
 
 
P.P.S.
 
—
 
If
 
your
 
budget
 
is
 
less
 
than
 
$3000,
 
we
 
can’t
 
help
 
you.
 
 
That
 
being
 
said
 
though,
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
a
 
LOT
 
of
 
free
 
value
 
from
 
us
 
at
 
no
 
cost.
 
 
 
We
 
share
 
all
 
our
 
methodologies,
 
tactics
 
and
 
strategies
 
on
 
our
 
Youtube
 
&
 
Instagram
 
page.
 
 
 
Just
 
send
 
us
 
a
 
message
 
and
 
we’ll
 
give
 
you
 
every
 
resource
 
we
 
have
 
at
 
no
 
cost.

'Insanity
 
is
 
doing
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
over
 
and
 
over
 
again
 
and
 
expecting
 
different
 
results.'
 
 
 
Well,
 
you
 
know
 
what
 
that
 
means?
 
 
 
That
 
your
 
clinic's
 
ads
 
are
 
probably
 
insane.
 
 
When
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
ads
 
that
 
everybody
 
else
 
uses,
 
3
 
things
 
happen:
 
 
1.
 
"Creative
 
inflation"
 
kicks
 
in.
 
 
People
 
get
 
bored
 
with
 
your
 
messaging
 
and
 
subconsciously
 
skip
 
your
 
ad.
 
 
 
That
 
leads
 
to
 
higher
 
lead
 
costs.
 
Fewer
 
patients.
 
Money
 
down
 
the
 
toilet.
 
 
2.
 
Potential
 
patients
 
can't
 
answer
 
"Why
 
should
 
I
 
choose
 
YOU?"
 
 
If
 
you
 
sound
 
like
 
everybody
 
else
 
and
 
look
 
like
 
everybody
 
else,
 
don't
 
expect
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
anybody
 
else.
 
 
3.
 
These
 
"FDA-Approved
 
Treatment"
 
ads
 
just
 
don't
 
work.
 
 
Here's
 
why:
 
 
Your
 
potential
 
patients
 
have
 
been
 
labeled
 
"treatment-resistant."
 
 
 
They've
 
tried
 
2+
 
medications.
 
They've
 
been
 
to
 
therapy.
 
Nothing
 
worked.
 
 
When
 
they
 
see
 
your
 
ad
 
screaming
 
"NEW
 
FDA-APPROVED
 
TREATMENT
 
FOR
 
DEPRESSION,"
 
they
 
think:
 
 
"I've
 
tried
 
FDA-approved
 
treatments.
 
They
 
didn't
 
work.
 
I'm
 
treatment-resistant.
 
This
 
won't
 
work
 
for
 
me
 
either."
 
 
Your
 
ad—no
 
matter
 
how
 
much
 
you
 
spend—reinforces
 
their
 
hopelessness.
 
 
That's
 
not
 
an
 
algorithm
 
problem.
 
That's
 
not
 
a
 
budget
 
problem.
 
 
That's
 
a
 
belief
 
problem.
 
 
And
 
you
 
can't
 
fix
 
a
 
belief
 
problem
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
messaging
 
everyone
 
else
 
is
 
using.
 
 
---
 
 
So
 
what's
 
the
 
solution?
 
 
Create
 
unique
 
video
 
ads
 
that
 
break
 
their
 
false
 
beliefs.
 
 
How?
 
 
1.
 
Use
 
video
 
(not
 
static
 
images)
 
2.
 
Base
 
ads
 
on
 
education
 
and
 
patient
 
success
 
stories
 
 
Not
 
stock
 
photos.
 
Not
 
recycled
 
messaging.
 
Actual
 
content
 
from
 
YOUR
 
clinic.

So
 
if
 
you're
 
tired
 
of
 
your
 
current
 
way
 
of
 
marketing,

Why
 
Most
 
Ketamine,
 
TMS,
 
Spravato
 
Clinic
 
Marketing
 
Underperforms
 
—
 
and
 
What
 
Actually
 
Works
 
in
 
2025
 
Most
 
Ketamine,
 
TMS,
 
and
 
Spravato
 
clinics
 
don’t
 
have
 
a
 
demand
 
problem.
 
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
communication
 
problem.
 
Marketing
 
often
 
talks
 
about:
 
 
✅
 
"FDA-approved
 
treatments"
 
✅
 
"Insurance
 
coverage
 
available"
 
✅
 
"Rapid
 
symptom
 
relief"
 
✅
 
"Warm,
 
supportive
 
environment"
 
It’s
 
not
 
wrong.
 
 
It’s
 
just
 
not
 
what
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
talk
 
about.
 
Because
 
the
 
truth
 
is
 
—
 
most
 
patients
 
don’t
 
make
 
decisions
 
based
 
on
 
clinical
 
features.
 

 
They’re
 
not
 
Googling
 
“FDA
 
approval”
 
when
 
they’re
 
lying
 
awake
 
at
 
2AM,
 
wondering
 
why
 
they
 
still
 
feel
 
broken.
 
 
They’re
 
looking
 
for
 
someone
 
who
 
actually
 
understands
 
what
 
they’re
 
going
 
through.
 
That
 
emotional
 
connection
 
and
 
trust-building
 
is
 
exactly
 
where
 
most
 
marketing
 
efforts
 
fall
 
short
 
—
 
and
 
why
 
so
 
many
 
clinics
 
struggle
 
to
 
reach
 
the
 
patients
 
who
 
need
 
them
 
most.
 
 
The
 
clinics
 
that
 
thrive
 
in
 
2025
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
connect
 
emotionally
 
first
 
—
 
and
 
build
 
clinical
 
trust
 
second.
 
So,
 
what’s
 
the
 
solution?
 
 
Great
 
question.
 
 
 
Meet
 
the
 
C.A.R.E.
 
Framework:
 
C
 
–
 
Clarity:
 
We’ll
 
Define
 
exactly
 
who
 
your
 
ideal
 
patients
 
are
 
—
 
and
 
craft
 
messaging
 
that
 
speaks
 
to
 
what
 
they're
 
really
 
feeling.
 
A
 
–
 
Authority:
 
We’ll
 
Position
 
your
 
clinic
 
as
 
the
 
trusted
 
expert
 
—
 
without
 
relying
 
on
 
generic
 
buzzwords
 
like
 
"FDA
 
Approved."
 
R
 
–
 
Reach:
 
We’ll
 
Launch
 
targeted
 
campaigns
 
that
 
bring
 
treatment-ready
 
patients
 
to
 
your
 
front
 
door,
 
month
 
after
 
month.
 
E
 
–
 
Education:
 
We’ll
 
Create
 
marketing
 
that
 
educates,
 
lowers
 
resistance,
 
builds
 
trust
 
and
 
makes
 
patients
 
take
 
the
 
first
 
step
 
toward
 
healing
 
—
 
before
 
they
 
even
 
walk
 
into
 
your
 
clinic.
 
 
Right
 
now,
 
to
 
build
 
my
 
brand
 
and
 
reputation
 
in
 
this
 
field,
 
I’m
 
looking
 
for
 
5
 
clinics
 
to
 
partner
 
with
 
on
 
a
 
pay-per-result
 
basis.
 
(Result
 
=
 
pre-paid
 
booked
 
patient)
 
If
 
you’re
 
serious
 
about
 
growing
 
your
 
clinic
 
in
 
a
 
sustainable,
 
ethical
 
way
 
—
 
Let's
 
build
 
something
 
that
 
actually
 
matters.

If
 
you

I’ll

we

a

AD
 
2:
 
Running
 
a
 
Convo
 
 
 
You’re
 
not
 
running
 
a
 
clinic.
 
You’re
 
running
 
a
 
conversation.
 
But
 
most
 
clinics
 
have
 
no
 
idea
 
what
 
kind
 
of
 
conversation
 
they’re
 
in.
 
When
 
a
 
potential
 
patient
 
sees
 
your
 
ad,
 
visits
 
your
 
website,
 
or
 
hears
 
your
 
voicemail…
 

That’s
 
a
 
moment.
 
And
 
in
 
that
 
moment
 
—
 
one
 
of
 
two
 
things
 
happens:
 
1.
 
They
 
say,
 
“These
 
people
 
get
 
it.
 
I
 
feel
 
safe
 
here.”
 
 
2.
 
Or
 
they
 
say
 
nothing,
 
scroll
 
past,
 
and
 
disappear.
 
 
The
 
difference?
 
 
It’s
 
not
 
your
 
treatment.
 
 
It’s
 
the
 
conversation
 
you’ve
 
created.
 
And
 
here’s
 
what
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
understand:
 
Nobody
 
wants
 
“treatment.”
 
 
People
 
want
 
to
 
stop
 
feeling
 
broken.
 
 
People
 
want
 
to
 
feel
 
seen.
 
 
People
 
want
 
to
 
feel
 
hope
 
without
 
pressure.
 
If
 
your
 
clinic
 
isn’t
 
creating
 
that
 
conversation
 
—
 
your
 
ads
 
won’t
 
convert.
 
 
Your
 
content
 
won’t
 
land.
 
 
Your
 
calendar
 
won’t
 
fill.
 
That’s
 
where
 
the
 
C.A.R.E.
 
Framework
 
comes
 
in.
 
It’s
 
not
 
about
 
hyping
 
up
 
what
 
you
 
offer.
 
 
It’s
 
about
 
shifting
 
how
 
patients
 
feel
 
the
 
moment
 
they
 
come
 
across
 
you.

Why
 
do
 
so
 
many
 
Ketamine
 
and
 
TMS
 
clinics
 
struggle
 
to
 
get
 
results
 
with
 
their
 
ads
 
—
 
even
 
when
 
there’s
 
obvious
 
demand?
 
There’s
 
only
 
1
 
way
 
to
 
actually
 
grow
 
a
 
clinic
 
offering
 
ketamine,
 
tms,
 
Spravato
 
or
 
psychedelic
 
therapy
 
in
 
2025.
 
In
 
the
 
next
 
60
 
seconds,
 
you’ll
 
find
 
out
 
what
 
it
 
is
 
A
 
Ketamine
 
clinic
 
I
 
spoke
 
with
 
was
 
paying
 
$412
 
per
 
lead
 
—
 
and
 
had
 
no
 
idea
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
disaster.
 
Here’s
 
exactly
 
why
 
that
 
happened
 
—
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
it
 
never
 
happens
 
to
 
you.
 
If
 
you're
 
offering
 
Ketamine,
 
Spravato
 
or
 
TMS
 
in
 
your
 
clinic
 
and
 
you've
 
been
 
burned
 
by
 
agencies
 
before,
 
this
 
video
 
will
 
explain
 
why
 
it
 
happened
 
The
 
U.S.
 
Ketamine
 
clinic
 
market
 
is
 
projected
 
to
 
double
 
by
 
2030
 
—
 
from
 
$3.4
 
billion
 
to
 
nearly
 
$7
 
billion.
 
Clinics
 
are
 
growing.
 
Demand
 
is
 
exploding.
 
 
`
So
 
why
 
are
 
you
 
still
 
struggling
 
to
 
get
 
patients?
 
This
 
video
 
will
 
show
 
you
 
exactly
 
why
 
—
 
and
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
instead.
 
The
 
U.S.
 
Ketamine
 
clinic
 
market
 
is
 
growing
 
10.6%
 
per
 
year.
 
There’s
 
more
 
demand
 
than
 
ever.
 
So
 
if
 
your
 
ads
 
aren’t
 
working
 
—
 
it’s
 
not
 
the
 
market.
 
It’s
 
you
 
or
 
your
 
agency's
 
fault.
 
In
 
the
 
next
 
60
 
seconds
 
I’ll
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
to
 
fix
 
it
