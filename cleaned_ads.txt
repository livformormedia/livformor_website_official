Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapist: Stop commoditizing your services in directories and do this instead. I've done research on more than a hundred websites of clinics that offer ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, and they have a very big problem. Their websites are just not doing the job that they're supposed to do. Meaning, if your main service is ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, this is what your main page and your website should focus on. You should have blog posts on it. You should have content. You should have testimonials. On over 100 websites, I have not seen any of these things. So I realize there's a huge gap. Your website is probably not generating you leads because it's not optimized. So you are sitting and competing for patients in directories and commoditizing your service. Maybe you even hired a marketing agency, but they didn't even understand what's the difference between a ketamine infusion and the profound change that you offer. We're going to build you a completely new, premium website at no cost, and no hidden fees, that is going to show your unique clinical voice, educate your patients, and make you look like the professional you are. The only thing that you're going to need to do to claim that? Is hop on a 30 to 45-minute call with us. Tell us exactly what you tried in the past and what are the results that you're looking to get. If it's a good fit and you're gonna like our energy, maybe we'll even work together to build your education-based marketing funnel that is going to attract qualified patients that understand what you do, understand the value of it, and are willing to pay you for it. And the best part is, if we do decide to work together, we only work on performance. Meaning you're only going to pay us when you get a qualified lead in the door. What is a qualified lead?
