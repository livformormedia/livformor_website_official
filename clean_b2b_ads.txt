I analyzed over 100 clinics in the Ketamine, TMS and Spravato space. And what I found was horrifying. ❌ Most of them are using stock images, the same “brain vs brain” ad, and the woman smiling next to a Spravao nasal spray picture. ❌ Most of them have zero video content. ❌ Most of them look, sound, and feel identical. So… What do your ads look like? If you’re in the same group of people that use the same ads… You need to change that. How? Start using video. But not just every video. A video of you. On camera. In your clinic (or a nice park, that also works), wearing your authoritative white coat. And if you’re thinking "I'm not comfortable on camera”... That's fine. But here’s what you’re missing out on: 1. Real Estate Video takes up more space in the feed. More space = more attention. 2. Trust People want to see who they're going to be working with. Your face builds trust faster than any stock photo ever will. 3. Authority When you're wearing your white coat, speaking with confidence, explaining how this works—you look like the expert you are. 4. Differentiation (USP) Your voice. Your clinic. Your approach. That's your unique selling point. Stock photos can't do that, nobody can copy and paste your unique videos. 5. Authenticity People can smell fake from a mile away. Real video = real connection. Once you do that? Your ads stop looking like everyone else's. People stop scrolling. They watch. They think: "This person actually knows what they're talking about, they know what I’m going through." And they book. And they not only book, they show up. So here's my offer: Book a 30-minute call with me. I'll audit your current ads for free. I'll show you: - What kind of video content you should be creating - How to film it (even if you hate being on camera) And if we work together, we'll handle all the editing and script creating process. You just film. We do the rest. And if you're not happy after 45 days? Full refund. (Also, you'll look great in that white coat. Trust me.) --- Look, you can keep running the same stock photos as everyone else. Or you can stand out. Your choice. Click below. Book the call.

Hook 2: How to finally get high-quality leads for your clinic, without hearing the same “give the algorithm time” excuses. Hook 3: If you offer Ketamine, Spravato or TMS, have you ever stopped for a second and asked yourself: If you offer Ketamine, Spravato or TMS, have you ever stopped for a second and asked yourself: Have you ever stopped for a second and asked yourself: “What does my agency actually track?” Do you know your numbers? Your cost per new patient in the chair? Not cost per lead. Not cost per click. Not "engagement rate." Cost per actual patient. Do they include their marketing fee in the expenses when they calculate it? (Spoiler: they probably don't.) Here's the thing that you already know: Leads don't pay your bills. Patients do. So let me ask you: Do you know your cost per acquiring a new patient? If the answer is "no" or "I think it's around…" We should talk. Because I can tell you that number in about 10 minutes.

Well, you know what that means? That your clinic's ads are probably insane. When you use the same ads that everybody else uses, 3 things happen: 1. "Creative inflation" kicks in. People get bored with your messaging and subconsciously skip your ad. That leads to higher lead costs. Fewer patients. Money down the toilet. 2. Potential patients can't answer "Why should I choose YOU?" If you sound like everybody else and look like everybody else, don't expect better results than anybody else. 3. These "FDA-Approved Treatment" ads just don't work. Here's why: Your potential patients have been labeled "treatment-resistant." They've tried 2+ medications. They've been to therapy. Nothing worked. When they see your ad screaming "NEW FDA-APPROVED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION," they think: "I've tried FDA-approved treatments. They didn't work. I'm treatment-resistant. This won't work for me either." Your ad—no matter how much you spend—reinforces their hopelessness. That's not an algorithm problem. That's not a budget problem. That's a belief problem. And you can't fix a belief problem with the same messaging everyone else is using. --- So what's the solution? Create unique video ads that break their false beliefs. How? 1. Use video (not static images) 2. Base ads on education and patient success stories Not stock photos. Not recycled messaging. Actual content from YOUR clinic. --- So if you're tired of your current way of marketing, book a 30 minute “Marketing Reset” call with us On this call, you'll see: ✅ How we create unique ads that form new beliefs ✅ Examples from our current clients ✅ How to read your marketing data like a pro ✅ A 30-day plan to fix your marketing And yes, all of this doesn't cost a dime.

They have a communication problem. Marketing often talks about: ✅ "FDA-approved treatments" ✅ "Insurance coverage available" ✅ "Rapid symptom relief" ✅ "Warm, supportive environment" It’s not wrong. It’s just not what you need to talk about. Because the truth is — most patients don’t make decisions based on clinical features. They’re not Googling “FDA approval” when they’re lying awake at 2AM, wondering why they still feel broken. They’re looking for someone who actually understands what they’re going through. That emotional connection and trust-building is exactly where most marketing efforts fall short — and why so many clinics struggle to reach the patients who need them most. The clinics that thrive in 2025 will be the ones that connect emotionally first — and build clinical trust second. So, what’s the solution? Great question. Meet the C.A.R.E. Framework: C – Clarity: We’ll Define exactly who your ideal patients are — and craft messaging that speaks to what they're really feeling. A – Authority: We’ll Position your clinic as the trusted expert — without relying on generic buzzwords like "FDA Approved." R – Reach: We’ll Launch targeted campaigns that bring treatment-ready patients to your front door, month after month. E – Education: We’ll Create marketing that educates, lowers resistance, builds trust and makes patients take the first step toward healing — before they even walk into your clinic. Right now, to build my brand and reputation in this field, I’m looking for 5 clinics to partner with on a pay-per-result basis.

You don’t have at least $1200/mo to invest in ads 2. You don’t have front desk staff that can call & book leads fast (Sub-5 minutes) 3. You don’t have a high ticket treatment plan to sell ($3K-$10K) AD 2: Running a Convo You’re not running a clinic. You’re running a conversation. But most clinics have no idea what kind of conversation they’re in. When a potential patient sees your ad, visits your website, or hears your voicemail… That’s a moment. And in that moment — one of two things happens: 1. They say, “These people get it. I feel safe here.” 2. Or they say nothing, scroll past, and disappear. The difference? It’s not your treatment. It’s the conversation you’ve created. And here’s what you need to understand: Nobody wants “treatment.” People want to stop feeling broken. People want to feel seen. People want to feel hope without pressure. If your clinic isn’t creating that conversation — your ads won’t convert. Your content won’t land. Your calendar won’t fill. That’s where the C.A.R.E. Framework comes in. It’s not about hyping up what you offer. It’s about shifting how patients feel the moment they come across you. ✅ C – Crafting messaging that makes patients say, “that’s me” ✅ A – Showing authority without sounding clinical ✅ R – Running ads that bring in believers, not browsers ✅ E – Creating trust before they ever pick up the phone I’m opening up 5 new client spots for clinics who want to implement this system now.
