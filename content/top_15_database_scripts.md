## Script #1

How to grow your cash-pay ketamine or esketamine TMS clinic — without paying a dollar until we deliver.

Most clinic owners in this space have been burned. You paid an agency a monthly retainer. They ran ads. Unqualified patients came in. Nobody showed. You paid again the next month anyway.

What we built is the opposite of that model.

You pay $99 per booked consultation. That's it. No retainer. No setup fee. No contract.

And before we launch a single ad — we sit down with you and agree on exactly what a booked consultation means for your clinic. Cash-pay. First contact with your practice. Pre-screened by our team. If it doesn't meet the standard you set, you don't pay.

But this isn't for everybody. Before we take on a clinic, there are three things we need to see.

One: You need to be running at least $100 a day in ad spend. This isn't for clinics that want to test with $500 a month. This is a real patient acquisition system that requires real volume.

Two: You need LegitScript certification. If you're running ketamine or Spravato ads on Google or Meta without it, your account will get suspended — and we can't run your campaigns without it. If you don't have it yet, we'll help you get it. But it needs to happen.

Three: You need to be willing to be on video. Ketamine and TMS are high-trust treatments. The clinics that win in this market are the ones where the owner shows up on camera. Stock photos don't build trust. Faces do.

If you check those three boxes — your cash-pay ketamine or TMS clinic is exactly who we built this for.

## Script #2

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

Cash-pay ketamine and esketamine TMS clinics — don't pay another dime in a marketing retainer before you watch this.

I'll tell you exactly what went wrong with the agency you hired.

They took your money on month one and ran ads to your homepage. Not a dedicated landing page — your homepage. With your navigation bar, six links, a staff photo. Every extra link on a landing page reduces your conversion rate. The traffic was there. The infrastructure wasn't built to catch it.

Month two: same thing. Maybe they updated the creative. You still paid.

When a patient inquiry did come in — someone who actually filled out your form, left their name and number, expressed interest in ketamine therapy — your team called them back a day later. MIT research is clear: you have a 5-minute window. After 5 minutes, the odds of qualifying that patient inquiry drop 80%. Your agency never told you that.

And when the patient inquiry said "let me think about it" — they sent one follow-up email and moved on. The patient considering ketamine for treatment-resistant depression who says "let me think about it" isn't saying no. They're scared. You needed seven touches minimum. You got one.

That's not bad marketing strategy. That's no strategy at all.

Here's what working with us looks like: you pay nothing until we deliver a booked consultation. $99 per pre-screened, cash-pay prospect who has been contacted by our team and consented to hear from your clinic. No retainer. No setup fee.

And before we launch — we sit down and define together exactly what a booked consultation means for you. You set the standard. We hit it.

One clinic per market. Your competitors don't get access to what we learn building your campaigns.

## Script #3

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

If you own a cash-pay ketamine or esketamine TMS clinic — here is an offer that no marketing agency will ever make to you.

We don't charge a retainer. We don't charge a setup fee. We don't take your money before we've proven we can produce.

You pay $99 per booked consultation. That's it.

But here's the part that actually separates this from every other performance model you've heard about: before we start, we sit down with you and agree on exactly what a booked consultation means. You tell us your standards. Cash-pay only? First-time contact with your practice? Must have expressed interest in a specific treatment? Fine. That's the definition. We get paid when we hit it.

If we don't deliver — you don't owe us a cent.

No agency offers this because most agencies can't back it up. They need the retainer because they're not confident enough in their results to tie their income to them. We are.

Now — this isn't for every clinic. There are three things we need from you before we'll even take on your market.

You need to be spending at least $100 a day in ad budget. This system is built for volume. It doesn't work on $500 a month.

You need LegitScript certification — or be willing to get it. Without it, you can't run ketamine or Spravato ads on Google or Meta without getting your account banned. We can walk you through the application. But it has to happen.

And you need to be willing to show your face on camera. The clinics winning in this market have owners who show up on video. This is not optional if you want to compete.

If you're running a cash-pay ketamine or esketamine TMS clinic — and you check those three boxes — link in bio. Four quick questions. If your market is open, we'll talk.

## Script #4

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

Before we take on a cash-pay ketamine or esketamine TMS clinic — we require three things. Most clinics can't check all three. Here's what they are.

One: At least $100 a day in ad spend. This isn't a test. This is a real patient acquisition system — and it needs real volume behind it to work. If you're not prepared to commit to $100 a day in budget, this isn't the right conversation yet.

Two: LegitScript certification. Running ketamine or Spravato ads on Google or Meta without LegitScript is how you get your account suspended. It's not optional. If you don't have it yet, we'll help you get it. But it has to be in place before we launch.

Three: Willingness to be on video. Your face. On camera. On TikTok, Reels, YouTube — regularly. The ketamine and TMS clinics that are growing right now are the ones where the owner shows up. Not stock photos. Not text graphics. You, on camera, talking about what you do and why it matters.

If you can check all three — this is what we offer in return.

No retainer. No monthly fee. No contract. You pay $99 per booked consultation — and before we run a single ad, we sit down together and agree on what that means. You define the standard. We meet it. One clinic per market. Exclusive.

We work with clinics that are ready to grow — not clinics that are hoping marketing might work. If that's you, link in bio. Four questions. Sixty seconds to see if your market is open.

## Script #5

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

Cash-pay ketamine and esketamine TMS clinic owners — I want to tell you exactly why marketing keeps failing you. And it's not what you think.

It's not the platform. It's not the algorithm. It's not that people aren't interested.

It's your infrastructure.

I've looked at the marketing setup of over 40 ketamine and TMS clinics. Almost all of them had the same three problems.

Their landing pages weren't built to convert. They were sending paid traffic to their homepage — with a navigation bar full of links and a "Welcome to our clinic" headline. Every extra link is an exit. The traffic was there. The system wasn't built to convert it.

Their response time was broken. MIT research: you have a 5-minute window to respond before your odds of qualifying that patient inquiry drop 80%. These clinics were calling back 24 hours later. The window was closed.

And they stopped at one or two follow-ups. A patient considering ketamine therapy for treatment-resistant depression who says "let me think about it" is scared — not gone. You need 7 touches minimum. They were sending one email and giving up.

Fix those three things — and the marketing that "doesn't work" suddenly starts working.

That's what we do. And we don't charge you until it does.

$99 per booked consultation. Before we start, we sit down and agree on exactly what that means — so you're never paying for a patient inquiry that doesn't meet your standard. No retainer.

One clinic per market. Link in bio — four questions to check if yours is available.

## Script #6

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

You hired a marketing agency for your ketamine or TMS clinic. It went wrong. And now you're starting to wonder if marketing even works — or if it's all just a scam.

It's not a scam. But your agency probably failed you. And there's a difference.

Here are the questions nobody asked you after it fell apart. Were the patient inquiries even qualified — or were they random people clicking on generic stock photo ads? When someone filled out your form, how fast did someone call them? Because MIT research shows that after 5 minutes, the odds of reaching a patient inquiry drop by 80%. Five minutes. And that's if you screened them at all before they gave you their name.

What did your ads actually look like? Clinical claims? Stock images? Or was there a real person — on camera — talking directly to the people who haven't found relief anywhere else? And your offer — was it a "free consultation"? That phrase is invisible in a crowded market. The right framing is the difference between a full calendar and an empty one.

Most agencies have one job: generate patient inquiries. Then they send you a report and call it a month. They don't help you call faster. They don't help you screen. They don't help you frame the offer. And they charge you the same retainer whether you closed anyone or not.

That's why it didn't work. Not because marketing is broken. Because the model is broken.

## Script #7

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

I won't ask for a single dollar in retainers if we can't help you become the number one ketamine or TMS clinic in your city.

Now, if you've been burned by marketing agencies before, I know that sounds like an unrealistic gimmick. But the reason I can say that is because we know exactly how to build patient acquisition systems specifically for cash-pay ketamine and TMS clinics.

Here is how it works. It's very simple. We come in and install our complete patient acquisition infrastructure to bring you financially and medically qualified patients. We handle the direct-response strategy, the ads, the landing pages, the pre-screening, and the tracking. 

But here is the catch. Because we take on the risk, we do not work with just any clinic. You need to have the operational capacity to handle volume, a budget that shows you're serious about growth, and a commitment to answering the phone when a patient needs you.

If you qualify, we sit down with you and define exactly what a 'booked consultation' means for your specific practice. 

When—and only when—a patient who meets your exact criteria reaches out, you pay us $99. That's it.

## Script #8

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

I've spoken to over 40 ketamine and TMS clinic owners in the last few months. Most of them said the same thing: "We got burned by an agency. Marketing doesn't work for us."

I didn't accept that. Because I knew the demand was there.

I dug deeper — and I found three patterns that showed up every single time.

Pattern one: They were sending paid traffic to their homepage. Not a dedicated landing page — their homepage. With six navigation links, a staff photo, and a "Welcome to our clinic" headline. Every extra link on a landing page bleeds your conversion rate. The traffic was there. The infrastructure wasn't built to catch it.

Pattern two: Their response time was broken. MIT research is clear — you have a 5-minute window to respond before your odds of qualifying a patient inquiry drop 80%. These clinics were calling back hours later. Sometimes the next day. The window was closed. The patient had moved on.

Pattern three: They stopped at one or two follow-ups. A patient considering ketamine therapy for treatment-resistant depression is scared. "Let me think about it" is not a no. It's fear. It means: I want this, but I'm terrified. Without 7 touches minimum, you're leaving the people who needed you most with no one showing up for them.

That's what we fix. And it's not complex. It's just a system.

The demand for ketamine and TMS therapy is real and growing. The problem was never the market. It was the infrastructure.

Follow for more breakdowns on exactly what's breaking clinic marketing — and how to fix it.

## Script #9

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

I'm going to say something that might sound unusual from a marketing person. We don't measure our success in revenue. We measure it in patients.

100,000 people who beat treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health conditions — through a ketamine or TMS clinic that we helped grow.

Let me tell you why that number doesn't feel impossible.

Right now, depression diagnoses are at record highs. Anxiety disorders are affecting more people than ever. PTSD is destroying the lives of millions of veterans, trauma survivors, people who've been through things they can't even put into words.

The country is more divided than ever. AI, political chaos, economic fear — all of it is making people feel like there's no way forward.

And there are treatments that have been proven — clinically, repeatedly — to work for people when nothing else has. Ketamine. TMS. Spravato. These are not experimental anymore. These are real tools in the hands of real clinic owners who got into this because they believe in the treatment.

The problem isn't the treatment. It's the marketing.

Most clinic owners are extraordinary clinicians. They are not marketers. They shouldn't have to be. That's what we're here for.

If we can help enough clinics reach enough of the right patients — the downstream impact is real. Not a dashboard stat. A person who can get out of bed. Who can be present for their family. Who is still here.

That's the 100,000 we're building toward.

Follow if you want to watch this happen in real time.

## Script #10

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

If your ketamine or TMS clinic ads say "FDA-approved" or "treatment-resistant depression" in the headline — I want to show you exactly what that does to your conversion rate.

Here is the psychology of the person you're trying to reach.

They've been suffering for years. They've tried SSRIs, maybe more than once. They've been in therapy. They've read about ketamine or TMS and they're hopeful — but they're also exhausted at the idea of trying another thing that might not work.

When your ad says "FDA-approved treatment for depression" — it triggers logic, not emotion. And with this audience, you need emotion first. Always.

You need them to feel understood before they feel interested.

What actually stops someone mid-scroll is a sentence that makes them think: "That's me. They're describing me."

"You've tried everything. The medication. The therapy. You're still here, still struggling — and somewhere in the back of your mind, you're starting to wonder if this is just how life is going to be."

That's a hook. That opens a door.

Then — you introduce ketamine or TMS not as a product, but as a mechanism. The specific reason it works differently for people who didn't respond to traditional treatment. The science, in plain language.

Emotion first. Mechanism second. Proof third. One clear CTA last.

That's the formula. And none of it involves "FDA-approved."

Follow for more on what actually converts in clinic advertising.

## Script #11

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

People ask me all the time: why do you only work with one ketamine or TMS clinic per city? You could work with five, ten in the same market and make dramatically more money.

Here's exactly why I don't.

First — if I'm running campaigns for two ketamine clinics in the same city, I'm competing against myself. Splitting data, splitting attention, splitting results. That's not a model built to win. It's a model built to spread responsibility thin enough that nobody has to take it seriously.

Second — exclusivity is part of what I'm selling. When you work with us, you're the only ketamine or TMS clinic in your market with our full system, our full attention, and everything we learn about patient acquisition in your specific geography. Your competitor can't access that.

Third — I want each clinic I work with to reach full capacity. Not partial capacity. Not "a little better than before." Full. That's the ambition. And you can't hold that ambition for ten clinics simultaneously.

We're not a volume operation. We don't onboard fifty clinics into a dashboard and run the same templated campaigns.

Every clinic we decide to work with is a deliberate choice. We have to believe we can get them there. Because the model only works — for us and for you — when patients actually show up.

One clinic per market. If yours is taken, it's taken.

## Script #12

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

Every ketamine and TMS clinic owner I've spoken to has tried at least one of these. Almost none of them have run all five at the same time. That's the problem.

Here's what a complete clinic marketing system actually looks like.

One: A dedicated landing page. Not your homepage. A page built for one specific treatment — ketamine, TMS, or Spravato — with one clear promise and one CTA. Every navigation link you leave on that page is a reason for someone to leave without committing.

Two: A paid channel. Google Ads for people actively searching for ketamine therapy or TMS near them. Meta for people who don't know they have options yet — which is a significantly larger audience than most clinics are targeting.

Three: Speed to patient inquiry. The moment someone fills out your form, they receive a response within 60 seconds. Automated, but personal. The 5-minute window is real — and it closes faster than most clinic owners think.

Four: A follow-up sequence. Seven touches minimum. Email, SMS, phone call. In a specific cadence. Most clinics send one email and give up. The patients who needed seven follow-ups to book a consultation are often the most committed patients you'll ever treat.

Five: Organic content. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube. Educational content that answers the questions your future patients are already asking. This doesn't just build your brand — it makes every paid ad you run convert at a dramatically higher rate because they've already seen you before they clicked.

These five things, running simultaneously. That's not a secret. That's just the system — when all of it is actually working.

Follow for the breakdown on each piece individually.

## Script #13

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

Here's how I would scale a cash-pay ketamine or TMS clinic in 2026.

My name is Oriel. I've run paid campaigns across 63 industries. Six months ago I walked away from all of it to focus exclusively on this space — because a close friend of mine is numb. Not sad. Not struggling. Numb. SSRIs, weed to cope. He is not the same person. And I realized the clinics that could actually help him couldn't reach him. So that's why I'm here.

Here's the framework. Five components. In the order I'd build them.

──────────

Component one: Be everywhere. Not just ads — everywhere.

Your CEO needs to be on camera. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube. Showing their face. Talking about the treatment. Building trust before the patient ever searches for you. At the same time — run paid ads on Instagram and Google simultaneously. Instagram for people who don't know they have options yet. Google for people who are actively searching. When a patient sees your face on their feed and then sees your ad on Google, something shifts. You go from a clinic to a known person. Trust happens at the intersection of frequency and familiarity, not just one ad.

Component two: Education-based marketing.

You are not selling a treatment. You are teaching someone why they are still suffering — and why the thing they haven't tried yet might be the reason they start to heal. If your ads patient inquiry with "FDA-approved" or a list of services, you're speaking to the logical brain. And this patient isn't here for logic. They're exhausted. They've been let down. You have to earn their belief before you earn their inquiry. Teach them the mechanism. Why ketamine works when SSRIs don't. Why TMS targets a different pathway. Give them language for what they've been feeling. Make them feel understood before they feel interested. That's how inquiries become consultations.

Component three: Five-minute follow-up. Not as a courtesy — as a system.

MIT research is clear: you have a five-minute window from the moment someone fills out your form before your odds of qualifying that patient inquiry drop by 80%. Five minutes. Not 24 hours. Not the next morning. Five minutes. The moment someone reaches out, they need to feel it. An automated text with a short personal video from the doctor. A call from a care coordinator. A piece of content that speaks directly to what they're going through. Not a confirmation email. A signal that says: we saw you, we're here, and you're not waiting. Book them directly to a consultation. The consultation is not the close — it's the next natural step for someone who just reached out at their most vulnerable moment. Make it easy. Make it fast. Make it feel human.

Component four: Stay with the scared ones.

Most patients considering ketamine or TMS therapy are terrified. Not because they don't believe in the treatment — but because they've been disappointed so many times before that hope feels dangerous. When they say "let me think about it," that is not a no. That is fear. Seven follow-ups minimum. Every touch point should say one thing: I'm still here. I believe we can help you. I'm not going anywhere. Not aggressive. Not pushy. Just present. Because the patient who needs seven touches to book a consultation is often the one who becomes your most loyal, most vocal, most transformed patient. Don't let them walk away because no one followed up.

Component five: Never give up on a no-show.

Some patients book a consultation and don't come. Life happens. Fear wins, temporarily. They went back to what's familiar, even if it's not working. Do not treat this as a lost patient. They booked. They raised their hand. They wanted this. Call them. Send a message. Not a script — a human one. Let them know you remember them. That the door is still open. That you're not following up because of the revenue — you're following up because you know what they're going through and you know what's possible for them when they walk through yours. The clinics that recover no-shows are the clinics that actually change lives at scale.

──────────

That's the framework. Omnipresence. Education. Five-minute follow-up. Fear nurture. No-show recovery.

Most clinics are running one or two of these. The ones that run all five — those are the ones that fill their calendars and actually serve the people who need them most.

## Script #14

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

If you own a ketamine or TMS clinic and you feel like marketing isn't working for you — before you blame the platform or the agency, answer these four questions honestly.

One: What type of ads are you running? Are you leading with clinical claims — "FDA-approved," "treatment-resistant depression"? Or are you using psychology, stories, analogies, testimonials, and real data that makes someone believe there is a better solution than the SSRIs they've already tried?

Two: What medium are you using? Random stock photos and generic images — or video? Are you on TikTok, Reels, YouTube? Are you letting people see your face and hear your voice? Authority in this space is built with presence, not graphics.

Three: How fast do you call your patient inquiries? Within 5 minutes of someone filling out your form — or 24 hours later? People dealing with depression especially need to feel seen the moment they reach out. The faster you respond, the more human you feel.

Four: Do you have an intro offer? Do you charge full price immediately — or do you let someone experience what you do first? Charging $190 for a first session instead of $400 or $500 changes everything. Let them feel what it does. You know what it does.

Here's the truth: there is no problem with the market. There is no problem with any platform. The demand is growing. More and more people are being diagnosed with depression and PTSD. They are looking for solutions.

The question is whether your system is built to reach them when they do.

## Script #15

> **Read on Teleprompter:**

If your ketamine or TMS clinic website starts with "Welcome to" — it's not converting. And here is the exact reason why.

The patient who lands on your website isn't reading your credentials. They're not looking at your awards or your staff photos. They're asking one question, silently: "Is this for someone like me? Can these people actually help me?"

If the first thing they see is your accolades, your navigation bar with six links, or your "state-of-the-art infusion center" headline — you've already lost them. You're speaking to yourself. And they came to hear about themselves.

Here's what the top of a converting ketamine or TMS landing page communicates:

"You've tried everything. The medication. The therapy. You're still struggling. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you're starting to wonder if this is just how life is going to be. It doesn't have to be."

Empathy first. Credentials second. Every time.

Then — one action to take. Not six links. Not a full navigation menu. One form. One button. Book your free call. That's it.

Every extra option you give someone is a potential exit. Every moment they spend thinking about what to click next is a moment they're not feeling understood.

The clinics that convert are the ones that make the patient feel immediately seen — and make it impossible to leave without taking one simple next step.
