## Script 1: The Vulnerability Window (Speed to Lead)

**[HOOK]**
If you own a ketamine or TMS clinic, you are probably losing sixty percent of your patients in what I call the "Vulnerability Window."

**[BODY]**
When a patient fills out a form on your website at eleven P.M., they have finally admitted they need help. They are in a heightened state of hope and extreme anxiety. 

If your front desk waits until ten A.M. the next day to call them back, that hope turns into protective pessimism. They wake up thinking, "I knew this wouldn't work out anyway." 

The first clinic to respond wins the patient seventy-eight percent of the time. You need an automated, empathetic SMS sequence that engages them within five minutes. Whether it's noon or midnight.

**[CTA]**
If you want the exact SMS sequence we use to secure cash-pay patients after hours, comment the word "SPEED" and I'll send it to you.

## Script 2: Care Coordinator vs. Medical Receptionist

**[HOOK]**
Stop hiring twenty-dollar-an-hour medical receptionists to sell four-thousand-dollar psychedelic therapy packages.

**[BODY]**
A standard receptionist verifies insurance, schedules appointments, and complains about the phones ringing. 

But when a severely depressed patient calls your clinic, they aren't looking for a schedule. They are looking for an anchor. 

You do not need a receptionist. You need an "Integration Guide." This is an empathetic sales professional who validates the patient's pain, manages their clinical expectations, and confidently explains the out-of-pocket investment—without ever apologizing for the price.

**[CTA]**
If your front desk is leaking high-ticket leads, go to the link in my bio and let's audit your intake process.

## Script 3: The "Too Expensive" Objection

**[HOOK]**
Here is exactly what you say when a patient tells your clinic that Ketamine therapy is "too expensive."

**[BODY]**
Never defend the price. And never just say "okay" and hang up. 

When they say it's too expensive, they are actually saying they are scared to invest in themselves because nothing else has worked. 

Step one: Validate. Say, "I totally understand. It is a significant financial investment." 
Step two: Isolate the concern. Ask, "But let me ask you—if money was absolutely not an issue, do you feel like this is the clinical breakthrough you’ve been looking for?" 

This instantly pivots the conversation away from their wallet, and back to their healing.

**[CTA]**
If you want my complete three-step script for handling price objections, comment "SCRIPT" and I'll DM it to you for free.

## Script 4: Stop Selling the Medicine

**[HOOK]**
If you run a psychedelic therapy clinic, you need to hear this right now: Stop selling the medicine.

**[BODY]**
Your website is packed with the history of ketamine, the mechanism of action, and neuroplasticity charts. 

Your patients do not care. They are not pharmacologists. They are severely depressed individuals who haven't slept through the night in three years. 

You need to sell "Life After the Medicine." Sell the ability to pick up their kids without feeling hollow. Sell the feeling of that heavy wet blanket finally being lifted off their chest. 

When you speak directly to their pain, the biochemistry becomes completely irrelevant.

**[CTA]**
If your website copy reads like a medical textbook, we need to talk. Link in bio to book a strategy session.

## Script 5: The Homepage Google Ads Mistake

**[HOOK]**
If you are running Google Ads for your TMS or Ketamine clinic and sending that traffic to your homepage... you are literally burning money.

**[BODY]**
Your homepage is a digital brochure with ten different links. 

When a patient searches "TMS therapy near me" in a panic, and clicks your ad, they do not want to see a dropdown menu about your staff's hobbies. 

They need a highly specific, dedicated landing page. One that only talks about TMS, answers their specific FAQs, and gives them exactly one action to take: Book a consultation. 

Every extra link on that page reduces your conversion rate by twelve percent.

**[CTA]**
Stop wasting ad spend. Comment "LANDING" and I'll send you the exact wireframe we use for high-converting clinic pages.

## Script 6: Google Maps / Local SEO

**[HOOK]**
If your mental health clinic is not ranking in the top three spots on Google Maps, you do not exist to local patients.

**[BODY]**
Ketamine and TMS are local, hyper-trust-based services. Patients do not want to drive an hour, and they rely heavily on reviews. 

The Google Map Pack captures over forty percent of all local search clicks. 

To get there, you need three things: 
One: Weekly Google Business Profile updates formatted like social media posts. 
Two: Perfect Name, Address, and Phone Number consistency across the web. 
Three: A systematic, HIPAA-compliant review generation system that asks patients for a ranking the moment they feel clinical relief.

**[CTA]**
If you need a system to dominate your local market, go to the link in my bio.

## Script 7: Stop Posting Generic Quotes

**[HOOK]**
Posting generic inspirational quotes on Instagram is not going to book patients for your therapy clinic.

**[BODY]**
If your clinic's social media grid is just Canva graphics of fake sunsets and quotes about resilience, you look exactly like everyone else. 

You need an "Integration-First" content strategy. 

Stop posting platitudes and start posting your clinical director looking directly into the camera. Have them deconstruct the exact fears your patients have before their first infusion. Have them talk about the raw vulnerability of opening up again. 

Authority is built by demonstrating that you intimately understand the patient's darkness.

## Script 8: The Spravato to IV Pipeline (Ascension Model)

**[HOOK]**
Here is why smart Ketamine clinics are utilizing Spravato to scale their cash-pay services.

**[BODY]**
We call this the Hybrid Ascension Model. 

Running Google Ads purely for high-ticket IV Ketamine is expensive. The patient acquisition cost is high because the financial barrier is massive. 

But Spravato is covered by insurance. When you market Spravato, your lead cost drops dramatically. You bring in a massive volume of patients, get them into your ecosystem, and establish clinical trust. 

Then, for the patients who need a deeper intervention, you organically ascend them into your premium, out-of-pocket IV or KAP programs. 

**[CTA]**
The insurance pays your staff, the cash-pay buys your freedom. Link in my bio to learn how to build this pipeline.

## Script 9: Word-of-Mouth is Dead

**[HOOK]**
If your clinic relies entirely on word-of-mouth and physician referrals, your business is one bad month away from crashing.

**[BODY]**
I talk to clinic owners every day who say, "We don't do marketing, we rely on our reputation." 

That is not a flex. That is a massive vulnerability. 

If the primary referring doctor in your network retires, or if a venture-backed competitor opens up down the street and outspends you, your patient pipeline dries up instantly. 

You need self-reliance. You need a predictable, inbound patient acquisition machine that you control. Turn it up when you want to scale, turn it down when you have a waitlist. 

**[CTA]**

## Script 10: Ketamine Commoditization

**[HOOK]**
Ketamine therapy is rapidly becoming a commodity. Do not let your clinic turn into an IV drip lounge.

**[BODY]**
Patients are starting to shop around for ketamine infusions strictly based on price, like they are buying a vitamin-B shot. 

If you try to compete on price, it is a race to the bottom. 

To survive the next three years, you have to differentiate based on the clinical container. You aren't selling a generic off-label anesthetic. You are selling a comprehensive, curated mental health transformation. 

Talk about your integration protocols. Talk about your aesthetic environment. Sell the outcome, not the drug.

**[CTA]**
If you are tired of losing patients to the cheapest clinic in town, comment "BRAND" and let's fix your positioning.

## Script 11: The Revenue Mix (TMS vs Ketamine)

**[HOOK]**
Which mental health treatment actually yields the highest profit margin: Ketamine, Spravato, or TMS?

**[BODY]**
It completely depends on your timeline. 

Cash-pay IV Ketamine has the highest immediate profit margin per session, often hitting eighty percent. No insurance clawbacks, low overhead. 

But TMS, while requiring significant upfront capital for the machine, offers the absolute highest lifetime value per patient. When properly billed to insurance, a single TMS patient can bring in eight to ten thousand dollars over a six-week protocol. 

The most profitable clinics in the country offer all three.

## Script 12: Answering Phones After Hours

**[HOOK]**
If a severely depressed patient calls your clinic at eight P.M. on a Friday, what happens?

**[BODY]**
Do they hit a generic voicemail telling them your business hours? 

Because if they do, they are going to hang up, go back to Google, and call the next clinic on the list until someone answers. 

Mental health crises do not operate on a nine-to-five schedule. If you cannot afford a twenty-four-seven answering service, you must have an automated AI text system that catches missed calls, acknowledges their pain, and books them on a calendar for Monday morning automatically.

**[CTA]**
If your missed calls are costing you thousands of dollars, comment "AUTO" and I'll send you our missed-call text-back blueprint.

---

## Script 13: Stop Being Afraid of the Cost

**[HOOK]**
Stop being secretly embarrassed by the cost of your ketamine treatments.

**[BODY]**
If your front desk stutters, drops their voice, or immediately apologizes when they quote a four-thousand-dollar package... the patient will never buy. 

Patients smell hesitation. If you aren't perfectly convicted that your treatment is worth the money, why should they be? 

You have an eighty percent success rate at giving people their lives back. You are providing the most powerful psychiatric breakthrough of the modern era. Say the price loudly, clearly, and with absolute pride.

## Script 14: Google Ads LegitScript Nightmare

**[HOOK]**
If you want to run Google Ads for your ketamine clinic, you have to get LegitScript certified, or your account will be permanently banned.

**[BODY]**
Google classifies ketamine as a controlled substance. You cannot just spin up an ad campaign on a Friday afternoon. 

You need a LegitScript certification. It takes about three to four weeks, requires a heavy vetting process, and costs around two thousand dollars a year. 

But here is the secret: Most of your local competitors are too lazy to do this. Which means the moment you get that badge, you have a massive, monopolized advantage on the search results.

**[CTA]**
If you want an agency that handles the LegitScript nightmare for you, hit the link in my bio.

## Script 15: The Truth About B2B Marketing for Clinics

**[HOOK]**
You didn't go to medical school to learn how to run Facebook Ads.

**[BODY]**
You became a doctor or a therapist to heal people. But right now, you are spending your weekends trying to figure out Zapier integrations, staring at broken funnels, and stressing over lead quality. 

Stop playing digital marketer. Every hour you spend trying to optimize an ad campaign is an hour you aren't treating patients or resting your mind. 

You need an agency partner that acts as a true growth ecosystem—one that handles the leads, the follow-up, and the patient acquisition so you can just focus on the medicine.

**[CTA]**
