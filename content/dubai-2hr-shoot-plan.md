## ⚡ BLOCK 1 — DIRECT OFFERS (Film First, Highest Energy)
*Pure performance. These go live as paid ads immediately.*

---

### 🔴 AD-1 — "You Pay Per Patient. Nothing Else."
**Target**: Cold audience, clinic owners  
**Duration**: 40–50s

**Bullet points to hit:**
- You're running ads. Or you have someone running them. You pay a retainer whether they work or not.
- There is a different model: you pay $49 when someone books, $249 when they actually show up. That's it.
- No retainer. No contract. No risk.
- We only work with one clinic per market. If yours is available — link in bio.

**CTA**: "4 questions in the link. Takes 60 seconds."

---

### 🔴 AD-2 — "Every Empty Chair Is Costing You $3K–$6K a Week"
**Target**: Cold audience, pain-aware owners  
**Duration**: 45s

**Bullet points to hit:**
- You have the equipment. You have the staff. You have the expertise.
- But the chairs are empty.
- That empty chair is costing you $3K to $6K every week in unrealized revenue.
- You don't need better medicine. You need a patient pipeline.
- We build the pipeline. You pay only when a patient shows up.

**CTA**: "Cash-pay clinics only. Link below."

---

### 🔴 AD-3 — "The Math Is Simple"
**Target**: Warm retargeting, decision-stage owners  
**Duration**: 40s

**Bullet points to hit:**
- Quick math for you.
- You pay us $298 total per patient in the door. ($49 to book, $249 to show.)
- Average cash-pay patient value: $3,000–$8,000.
- That's a 10x to 25x return on every patient.
- Name one other investment in your clinic that does that.

**CTA**: "If you're cash-pay and you want those numbers — link in bio."

---

### 🔴 AD-4 — "Your Competitor Is Eating Your Lunch Right Now"
**Target**: Cold audience, competitive angle  
**Duration**: 45s

**Bullet points to hit:**
- There's a clinic 20 minutes from you that's fully booked. Same services. Same area. Same market.
- What do they have that you don't? A system.
- They're running ads. Following up in 5 minutes. Closing 60–70% of consults.
- While you're wondering why the phone isn't ringing — they're hiring more staff.
- Which clinic do you want to be?

**CTA**: "One clinic per market. Check if yours is open — link below."

---

### 🔴 AD-5 — "If You've Been Burned by Agencies Before — Good."
**Target**: Cold + retargeting, objection-aware  
**Duration**: 50s

**Bullet points to hit:**
- You've tried Facebook ads. They didn't work. I believe you.
- Here's why: whoever ran your ads optimized for leads. Not patients. Big difference.
- And they got paid whether you got patients or not. That's the broken model.
- We get paid ONLY when a patient shows up. If you get zero — we make zero.
- So test us. The worst that happens is you get free leads.

**CTA**: "Zero retainer. Zero risk. Link in bio."

---

## 🔥 BLOCK 2 — FOUNDER VOICE (The Ones That Build Trust + Close)
*These convert retargeting audiences and warm people who've seen your direct ads.*

---

### 🟡 FV-1 — "Three Reasons Your Clinic's Marketing Failed"
**Source**: FV-01 (already written — USE THIS SCRIPT)  
**Duration**: 90s  
**This is your strongest script. Film it exactly as written.**

**Key beats:**
1. The creative — you're using "FDA-approved" which creates a belief problem for treatment-resistant patients
2. The agency had no skin in the game — retainer model is broken
3. What happened after the lead — no speed to contact, empathy fail

**This is the one that builds real understanding and authority.**

---

### 🟡 FV-2 — "I Built a Business I Can't Escape If I Underperform"
**Source**: FV-05

**Bullet points:**
- No retainers. $49 per booked patient, $249 per show. That's our only revenue.
- I don't have a consulting package to fall back on. If you don't get patients — I don't eat.
- That changes EVERYTHING about how we work.
- I cap at 6 clinics a month. Not capacity — attention. I can't afford to dilute.
- That's not a pitch. That's why it actually works.

---

### 🟡 FV-3 — "The 100,000 People Mission"
**Source**: FV-04

**Bullet points:**
- I've talked to clinic owners changing lives — patients who'd been suicidal, couldn't get out of bed, tried every medication
- The bottleneck between those patients and treatment isn't clinical. It's marketing.
- My goal: help clinics collectively reach 100,000 people who've been told there's nothing left for them
- I only get paid when a patient shows up. So every person who walks through your door — that's someone we reached together.

---

### 🟡 FV-4 — "Stop Using FDA-Approved as Your Hook"
**Source**: FV-03

**Bullet points:**
- Your ideal patient has already tried FDA-approved treatments. Multiple. They all failed. They're treatment-resistant.
- When they see your ad say "FDA-approved treatment" — they think: "already tried that, won't be different."
- You've created a belief problem with your own hook.
- You need to meet them where they are — acknowledge what they tried, explain the MECHANISM of why ketamine/TMS is different.
- Different message. Same budget. Way more patients.

---

### 🟡 FV-5 — "My Best Friend Idan"
**Source**: FV-04 body / ORG-13 angle

**Bullet points (personal, emotional — this is the mission video):**
- My best friend has been on antidepressants since he was a teenager. He's 21. Scared to change.
- He doesn't know about TMS. Doesn't know about ketamine. Doesn't know there's a world where you can feel better without a pill.
- That's why I do this. Not for the money — for every Idan who hasn't found the right clinic yet.
- When I fill your chairs, I'm not building your revenue. I'm giving someone their life back.

---

## 🌱 BLOCK 3 — ORGANIC CONTENT (Value-Driven, No Selling)
*These go on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts. They build your audience and warm up future buyers.*

---

### 🟢 ORG-1 — "Why Your Website Isn't Converting"
**Duration**: 45–60s

**Bullet points:**
- Your website gets traffic. You get almost no leads. Here's why.
- 3 reasons: no clear offer above the fold, no social proof that's specific, no urgency or next step
- Most clinic websites are built to look good — not to convert
- Fix those 3 things and the same traffic starts turning into booked consults

---

### 🟢 ORG-2 — "The Retainer Trap (Organic Version)"
**Duration**: 45s — *Organic/educational angle, no pitch*

**Bullet points:**
- If you're paying a marketing agency $3K–$5K a month — ask them one question
- "What's my cost per patient — not per lead, per patient who actually sat in my chair?"
- If they can't answer that immediately and specifically — you're being billed for their guesses
- Good marketing is measurable. Always.

---

### 🟢 ORG-3 — "The 5-Minute Response Rule"
**Duration**: 40s

**Bullet points:**
- MIT study: if you don't respond to a lead within 5 minutes, your chance of converting them drops by 80%
- After 30 minutes? Basically dead.
- Most clinics respond in 24–48 hours. That's not follow-up. That's abandonment.
- These are people who worked up courage to reach out. Speed IS empathy.

---

### 🟢 ORG-4 — "The 360 Strategy — Why You Can't Just Run Ads"
**Duration**: 60s

**Bullet points (this is the "full stack" concept you mentioned):**
- Running ads alone is like fishing with one hook in a lake full of fish
- The clinics that dominate? They're doing all of it: ads to generate demand, content to build trust, email/SMS follow-up to convert, reviews to build organic reach
- Each piece feeds the others. Ads bring leads. Content warms leads. Email converts. Reviews generate more leads.
- That's the flywheel. And it's why some clinics grow fast and others plateau.

---

### 🟢 ORG-5 — "3 Types of Ads Every Clinic Needs"
**Duration**: 50s

**Bullet points:**
- Most clinics run zero ads. The ones that run ads usually run just one type.
- You need 3: Awareness (educate people who don't know TMS/ketamine exist), Social proof (real results, real patients), Direct response (book now, limited spots)
- Running all 3 simultaneously is the formula.
- Awareness warms them up. Social proof builds trust. Direct response closes.

---

### 🟢 ORG-6 — "Why Posting on Instagram 3x a Week Isn't a Strategy"
**Duration**: 40s

**Bullet points:**
- I hear it constantly: "We're focusing on organic growth right now."
- Translation: you're doing nothing.
- Organic social for a local clinic gets you 200 views from people who already follow you.
- Paid reach puts you in front of thousands of people in your city who are ready to act.
- Organic is for trust. Paid is for growth. You need both.

---

### 🟢 ORG-7 — "What a Performance-Based Marketing Model Actually Means"
**Duration**: 50s (edu/organic version of your offer)

**Bullet points:**
- Most business models in marketing: charge a retainer, deliver a report, repeat
- Performance-based actually means: we don't get paid unless you get results. Zero retainer. Zero contract.
- If we don't deliver — we make nothing. That's what aligned incentives look like.
- It's rare because most agencies can't execute consistently enough to survive that model.

---

### 🟢 ORG-8 — "The Show Rate Secret"
**Duration**: 40s

**Bullet points:**
- Your show rate is probably 50–60%. It should be 80%.
- Biggest reason it's low: you're not sending anything between booking and appointment
- Add: a text confirmation same day, reminder 24 hours before, 2-hour reminder, "what to expect" video
- Those 4 automations can push your show rate from 55% to 80%+. That's 25% more revenue with zero extra ad spend.

---

### 🟢 ORG-9 — "The 63 Industries, One Mission"
**Duration**: 45s

**Bullet points (founder story / organic trust builder):**
- I've worked in 63 industries. SaaS, e-commerce, real estate, legal, medical.
- I chose this one on purpose. Not because the margins are good — because the outcome actually matters.
- When I help a clinic grow, they treat more patients. Those patients get their lives back.
- Marketing gym memberships doesn't hit the same.
- This work is purpose-driven.

---

### 🟢 ORG-10 — "You Deserve to Feel Good" (B2C / Patient-Facing)
**Duration**: 40s — *This goes on patient-facing content, not clinic owners*

**Bullet points:**
- If you've been suffering so long you've forgotten what "good" feels like — this is for you.
- You are not your depression. There is a person under that pain who deserves to come back.
- Treatments exist that don't just help you cope — they physically change your brain.
- TMS. Ketamine. Spravato. These aren't alternatives. They're advanced medicine.
- Don't give up. The answer might be one appointment away.

## ⚡ QUICK REMINDERS

- **Look directly into camera for ads** — trust and urgency
- **Look slightly off-camera for organic** — feels like you're talking to a friend
- **Stand up for ads** — energy. Sit or lean for organic — authority
- **Pause 2 seconds before each take** — cleaner cuts for editor
- **Don't restart if you stumble** — keep going, editor will cut it
- **Water between every 5 videos** — your voice will crack around video 12
