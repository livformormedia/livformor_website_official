## Script 1: The 360 Marketing Strategy Clinics Actually Need (ID: SORG-01)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
Everyone's telling you to run ads. But ads without a strategy behind them are just burning money. Here's what a real 360 marketing system looks like for a clinic.

**[BODY]**
Here's what a 360 clinic marketing strategy actually looks like. You need five things working at the same time.

One: A landing page that's designed to convert. Not your homepage. A dedicated page for each treatment, with one CTA.

Two: A paid channel. Google Ads for active searchers who are ready to book. Meta for building awareness with people who don't know they have options.

Three: A speed-to-lead system. Sub-60-second automated response the moment someone fills out a form. You lose 80% of leads if you wait more than 5 minutes.

Four: A follow-up sequence. Seven touches minimum. Email, text, call. Most clinics do one follow-up and give up.

Five: Organic content. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube — trust-building content that makes every ad you run convert at a higher rate.

That's it. The clinics that are growing 20, 30 patients a month aren't doing anything magic. They're just running all five of these simultaneously.

**[CTA]**
Follow if you want the breakdown on any of these five.

## Script 2: Why Your Clinic Website Isn't Converting (ID: SORG-02)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
If your clinic website starts with 'Welcome to' — it's not converting. Here's why.

**[BODY]**
The number one mistake I see on clinic websites: they're written for the doctor, not the patient.

The patient who lands on your site isn't reading your credentials. They're asking one question: "Is this for someone like me?"

Here's what the first thing on your website should communicate: "You've tried everything. Nothing worked. You're still here, and that matters. Here's what we can do."

Not — "Welcome to our state-of-the-art ketamine infusion center."

Empathy first. Credentials second. Every single time.

And then one thing to click. Not six links. Not a navigation bar full of options. One thing. Book a call. Fill out the form. That's it.

Our blog post breaks this down with specific before-and-after examples. Link in bio. But the short version is: if your website is about you, it's not working.

**[CTA]**
If you want us to look at your clinic's website for free — DM me the link.

## Script 3: The Retainer Trap — And Why I Walked Away From It (ID: SORG-03)
**Angle/Framework:** Founder Story / Narrative | **Targeting:** Solution Aware

**[HOOK]**
I could charge clinic owners a $5,000/month retainer. I chose not to. Here's why that was the most important business decision I made.

**[BODY]**
When I started building this business, I looked at how every other clinic marketing agency structured their deals. Retainer. Retainer. Retainer.

Three, five, ten thousand dollars a month. Whether they deliver patients or not. Whether your clinic grows or not.

And I sat with that for a while. Because I'd already been on the other side of it — paying for ads that didn't work, trusting an agency with my money and getting nothing back.

So I built a different model. You pay $99 per qualified inquiry — pre-screened, cash-pay, first contact, consented to be contacted. Zero retainer. Zero monthly fee. Zero risk.

The only way we win is if you win. That's the whole point.

Is it more work for us? Yes. Do we only take clients we're confident we can deliver for? Absolutely. But that's exactly how it should be.

## Script 4: Your Consultation Show Rate Is Killing Your Revenue (ID: SORG-04)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
The average consultation no-show rate for mental health clinics is between 30 and 50 percent. That means you're losing half your potential revenue before the patient ever walks in the door.

**[BODY]**
Here's the thing most clinics don't realize: your show rate is often a bigger problem than your lead volume.

You could be generating 30 leads a month and converting 5 patients. Or you could be generating 20 leads and converting 12. The difference is your show rate.

What drives show rate? Three things.

One: Speed to lead. If you respond within 5 minutes, the patient is still mentally present in their decision. If you wait 3 hours, they've moved on or they've talked themselves out of it.

Two: The confirmation sequence. Text the day before, text two hours before. Most clinics send one reminder email. That's not enough.

Three: What happens on the consultation call. If it feels like an interrogation instead of a conversation, patients don't come back.

Fix your show rate before you increase your ad spend. Every additional patient you convert from existing leads costs you zero in acquisition spend.

**[CTA]**
DM me 'SHOW RATE' and I'll send you the 3-step confirmation sequence we use.

## Script 5: Why Posting 3x a Week Does Nothing for Your Clinic (ID: SORG-05)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
Everyone tells you to post three times a week on Instagram. Nobody tells you why it almost never actually turns into patients for a clinic. Here's the thing they're missing.

**[BODY]**
Content doesn't convert by itself. I need you to hear that.

You can post every single day — and if there's no CTA, no bio link, no landing page, no follow-up — you're building brand awareness for a brand that has no conversion mechanism. You're just... existing online.

Here's what actually works for clinic social media:

Your content educates. Your bio link converts. And there has to be a direct path from the video the person watched to the form they fill out.

The content you make should be answering the three questions every potential patient has:
What is this treatment? Is it right for me? How do I get started?

Answer those three questions across your content. Make every video end with one call to action. Have one link in your bio that goes to a dedicated landing page.

That's when social media starts working. Not when you post three times a week and hope.

**[CTA]**
Follow for specific content frameworks that actually bring in consultations.

## Script 6: The 5-Minute Rule That Changes Everything (ID: SORG-06)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
MIT did a study on lead response times. The clinics that respond within 5 minutes are 100 times more likely to convert that lead than clinics that wait 30 minutes. One hundred times.

**[BODY]**
Here's the reality: a patient who fills out your form at 7 PM on a Tuesday is in a window.

They made an emotional decision. They finally decided to do something. They searched. They clicked. They typed their name and number into your form. They hit submit.

And then — what? They wait for you to call them back tomorrow morning.

By then, they've talked themselves out of it. They've told themselves it's too expensive. They've filled out two other clinic forms. That window is closed.

The fix is not expensive. An automated text — "Hi, we got your form. We'd love to connect. Can we call you in the next 10 minutes?" — sent within 60 seconds of them hitting submit.

That one change, at clinics I've worked with, can double consultation bookings from existing ad spend.

You don't need more leads. You need to actually catch the leads you have.

Want the exact automation setup for this? DM me.

## Script 7: You Pay When Patients Show Up. That's It. (ID: SORG-07)
**Angle/Framework:** undefined | **Targeting:** Solution Aware

**[HOOK]**
For the clinic owners who've been burned by marketing agencies — this is for you specifically.

**[BODY]**
Real quick — because I know most of you have been burned.

Here's how we work. You pay $99 when a qualified, pre-screened, cash-pay prospect is delivered to your clinic. That's the only fee.

You never pay a monthly retainer. There is no contract. If we don't bring you patients who show up — you don't pay.

We only take one clinic per market. Right now there are open markets.

If you're a ketamine, TMS, or Spravato clinic and you want to know if your market is available — four qualifying questions in the link in my bio. Takes sixty seconds.

That's it.

**[CTA]**
Link in bio. Four questions. Sixty seconds.

## Script 8: Google Ads for Ketamine Clinics — What Nobody Tells You (ID: SORG-08)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
Did you know that ketamine and Spravato clinics need a special certification just to run Google Ads? And most clinics trying to run ads don't have it?

**[BODY]**
There's a reason most ketamine and Spravato clinics either skip Google Ads entirely or get suspended immediately.

It's called LegitScript certification. Ketamine and Spravato are controlled substances. Google requires third-party certification from LegitScript before you can run any paid ads for these treatments. Without it — your ads get disapproved, and repeated violations can get your account permanently banned.

TMS doesn't require LegitScript. But it still falls under Google's sensitive health content policies — so you still can't just run any ad.

The certification costs about $2,000 a year and takes 2 to 4 weeks. And most clinics don't know about it until after they've already been suspended.

Here's the good news: because this barrier exists, the clinics that do it correctly have dramatically less competition. A well-certified ketamine clinic on Google Ads in a mid-size market might face two or three real competitors. Not twenty.

The full breakdown is in our blog — link in bio. But if you're going to run Google Ads, start with LegitScript. Everything else in the strategy depends on it.

## Script 9: Your Social Media Is Leaking Patients Right Now (ID: SORG-09)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Unaware

**[HOOK]**
71% of patients research a provider on social media before booking. If your clinic profile has posts from 2022 and no active stories — you're losing patients to clinics that are less experienced than you.

**[BODY]**
Before a patient books, they look you up. They always do.

They see your ad. They're interested. They google you. They click to your Instagram. And what they see either confirms their decision — or kills it.

An abandoned Instagram profile with 12 posts from last year and zero stories communicates one thing: this clinic is not active, and maybe not legitimate.

You don't need to go viral. You don't need a content team. You need three things on your social profile:

One — recent posts. Within the last two weeks, minimum.

Two — content that answers their questions. What is ketamine therapy? What does a session feel like? What do your patients experience?

Three — proof that there are humans here. Behind-the-scenes clips. Staff faces. Real moments.

Seventy-one percent of patients research you on social before they book. Make sure what they find makes them more confident — not less.

**[CTA]**
Follow and I'll give you a 90-day content framework for clinic social media.

## Script 10: The Real Math on Getting a New Ketamine Patient (ID: SORG-10)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
A well-managed Google Ads campaign for a ketamine clinic has a cost per patient acquisition of $300 to $500. A ketamine series costs the patient $4,000 to $6,000. Do that math.

**[BODY]**
Let me just do the math out loud for a second.

In a well-run Google Ads campaign for a ketamine clinic, cost per click is typically $8 to $15. With a converting landing page, you're looking at a $75 to $150 cost per lead. And if your consultation show rate and close rate are solid — patient acquisition cost lands between $300 and $500.

A ketamine infusion series costs the patient $4,000 to $8,000 depending on the market. Spravato can be $6,000 to $20,000 over a course of treatment.

So you're spending $300 to $500 to acquire a patient worth $4,000 to $20,000. The return on investment is 8:1 to 40:1 depending on the treatment.

The math works. The question is whether your marketing is set up correctly to capture it.

Most clinic Google Ads campaigns I audit are not. They're sending traffic to homepages, not landing pages. They're missing LegitScript certification. They have no follow-up sequence.

Fix the infrastructure — the math takes care of itself.

## Script 11: 3 Numbers Every Clinic Owner Should Know (ID: ORG-01)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Unaware

**[HOOK]**
If you own a mental health clinic, these 3 numbers will determine whether your clinic thrives or dies in the next 3 years.

**[BODY]**
Here are the three numbers. Number one — 500%. That's how much ketamine prescriptions increased from 2017 to 2022. The demand is EXPLODING. Number two — 67%. That's the percentage of depression patients who DON'T respond to SSRIs. Two-thirds. They need alternatives — and they're actively looking right now. Number three — 5 minutes. That's the window MIT found where your odds of qualifying a lead drop 80%. If your team isn't responding within 5 minutes, you're losing patients you already paid to attract. 500%. 67%. 5 minutes. Every decision you make about your clinic should revolve around these three numbers.

## Script 12: How Meta Banned Mental Health Targeting (ID: ORG-02)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
In 2022, Meta removed the ability to target users by medical condition. And most mental health marketers STILL haven't adapted.

**[BODY]**
Before 2022, you could target people interested in 'depression treatment' or 'anxiety medications' on Meta. That's gone. Removed. And most agencies in this space still haven't figured out what to do about it. Here's what works now: you target by behavior and geography, not by condition. You target people who've visited competitor websites. You build lookalike audiences from your existing patient data. You use education-first creative that self-selects the right audience. 'If you've tried multiple medications and nothing has worked…' — that line targets treatment-resistant depression without ever mentioning it. The restriction isn't a limitation. It's a FILTER that separates sophisticated marketers from amateurs.

## Script 13: The 5-Minute Rule (ID: ORG-03)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Problem Aware

**[HOOK]**
MIT found that responding to a lead within 5 minutes makes you 80% more likely to qualify them. After 30 minutes? It drops to nearly zero.

**[BODY]**
A person struggling with treatment-resistant depression just filled out your form. In that moment — they're at peak courage. Peak motivation. Peak openness. 5 minutes later? Doubt creeps in. 'Maybe I should try therapy again.' 'What if the side effects are bad?' 'My spouse won't understand.' 30 minutes later? They've talked themselves out of it. An hour later? They've forgotten they filled out the form. Speed to lead isn't just a metric — it's the difference between a patient who gets help and one who continues suffering. Every minute you wait, you lose more patients than you gain from better ads.

**[CTA]**
Follow if you want to stop losing the leads you already have.

## Script 14: How to Create Ads That Don't Get Banned (ID: ORG-04)
**Angle/Framework:** Educational Value Drop | **Targeting:** Solution Aware

**[HOOK]**
How many of your ketamine or TMS ads has Meta rejected? Follow these 5 rules to never get banned again.

**[BODY]**
Rule 1 — never use before-and-after implications. Don't show 'sad person becomes happy person.' Rule 2 — never reference specific medical conditions in ad copy. Say 'If traditional treatments haven't worked for you' not 'If you have treatment-resistant depression.' Rule 3 — never use the word 'cure' or anything that implies guaranteed outcomes. Use 'response rates' and 'clinical studies show.' Rule 4 — avoid showing medical procedures in ad creative. Educational diagrams are fine; actual IV insertions are not. Rule 5 — always include a disclaimer when citing clinical data. 'Individual results may vary' isn't optional — it's mandatory. Follow these 5 rules and your ad account stays clean.

**[CTA]**
Save this. Share it with your marketing team. Follow for more.

## Script 15: Why Your Landing Page Doesn't Convert (ID: ORG-05)
**Angle/Framework:** Problem → Agitate → Solve | **Targeting:** Solution Aware

**[HOOK]**
The average healthcare landing page converts at 2.3%. Ours convert at 8 to 12%. Here are the 3 differences.

**[BODY]**
Mistake 1 — too many navigation options. Your landing page should have ONE action: fill out the form. No menu bar. No 'About Us.' No 'Meet Our Team.' ONE path forward. Mistake 2 — your form asks for too much. Name, email, phone. That's it. Every additional field drops conversion by 10%. Don't ask for insurance details, medical history, or address on the FIRST form. Mistake 3 — no social proof above the fold. Patients need to see that other people have trusted you BEFORE they share their information. A rating, a review count, a trust badge — something. Fix these 3 things and watch your conversion rate double within a week.
