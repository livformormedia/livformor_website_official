Why
 
do
 
so
 
many
 
Ketamine
 
and
 
TMS
 
clinics
 
struggle
 
to
 
get
 
results
 
with
 
their
 
ads
 
—
 
even
 
when
 
there’s
 
obvious
 
demand?
 
There’s
 
only
 
1
 
way
 
to
 
actually
 
grow
 
a
 
clinic
 
offering
 
ketamine,
 
tms,
 
Spravato
 
or
 
psychedelic
 
therapy
 
in
 
2025.
 
In
 
the
 
next
 
60
 
seconds,
 
you’ll
 
find
 
out
 
what
 
it
 
is
 
A
 
Ketamine
 
clinic
 
I
 
spoke
 
with
 
was
 
paying
 
$412
 
per
 
lead
 
—
 
and
 
had
 
no
 
idea
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
disaster.
 
Here’s
 
exactly
 
why
 
that
 
happened
 
—
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
it
 
never
 
happens
 
to
 
you.
 
If
 
you're
 
offering
 
Ketamine,
 
Spravato
 
or
 
TMS
 
in
 
your
 
clinic
 
and
 
you've
 
been
 
burned
 
by
 
agencies
 
before,
 
this
 
video
 
will
 
explain
 
why
 
it
 
happened
 
The
 
U.S.
 
Ketamine
 
clinic
 
market
 
is
 
projected
 
to
 
double
 
by
 
2030
 
—
 
from
 
$3.4
 
billion
 
to
 
nearly
 
$7
 
billion.
 
Clinics
 
are
 
growing.
 
Demand
 
is
 
exploding.
 
 
`
So
 
why
 
are
 
you
 
still
 
struggling
 
to
 
get
 
patients?
 
This
 
video
 
will
 
show
 
you
 
exactly
 
why
 
—
 
and
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
instead.
 
The
 
U.S.
 
Ketamine
 
clinic
 
market
 
is
 
growing
 
10.6%
 
per
 
year.
 
There’s
 
more
 
demand
 
than
 
ever.
 
So
 
if
 
your
 
ads
 
aren’t
 
working
 
—
 
it’s
 
not
 
the
 
market.
 
It’s
 
you
 
or
 
your
 
agency's
 
fault.
 
In
 
the
 
next
 
60
 
seconds
 
I’ll
 
show
 
you
 
how
 
to
 
fix
 
it
