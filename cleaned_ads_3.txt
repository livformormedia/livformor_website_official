Hooks Hook 1 Ketamine-assisted psychotherapists, Give me 60 seconds, and I'll show you exactly how you can never pay a single retainer to any agencies again. Hook 2 Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapists. On the screen is a one dollar bill, and I'm not going to charge you even that we're not going to make you the number one practice in your area, here’s how. Hook 3 Ketamine-assisted psychotherapists, stop paying marketing retainers and do this instead. Hook 4 Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, here is the number one marketing mistake that is harming your marketing. There is only one real way to grow your Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy practice in 2026, and it's not by: ● hiring another agency ● putting more money into ad budget ● chasing down leads on shared lead websites empathetic ad You became a Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapist to facilitate real breakthroughs. But right now, you're probably feeling the weight of clinical burnout. You have patients with severe PTSD and treatment-resistant depression. You've been doing traditional talk therapy with them for months, maybe years, and the needle just isn't moving. That's exactly why you integrated Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy into your practice. You wanted to give them that hardware-level reset. But here is the tragic irony. You have this transformative modality, but scaling it feels impossible. You despise "salesy" marketing. You don't want to run aggressive ads. You just want to connect with the patients who desperately need this intervention. What you need isn't traditional lead generation. You need an education-first patient journey. You need a system that sits between the noise of the internet and your consultation calendar—a system that educates a struggling patient on why KAP works when SSRIs failed, so that by the time you speak with them, they already trust you. That is what we build at LivForMor. We craft the messaging and pre-screen the inquiries so you only talk to cash-pay patients ready for deep integration. And we do it on a purely performance basis—you only pay $99 per qualified, booked consultation. We are on a mission to reach 100,000 people suffering from treatment-resistant depression. We can't do that without practitioners like you expanding your capacity. If you run a KAP practice and you want to scale it ethically and predictably, send me a DM with the word "PRACTICE" and I'll show you exactly how our system works. Ad 2 You may be thinking that marketing is a scam or that agencies cannot do a good job, but the truth is there has been a problem in your messaging. You see, people have heard of IV ketamine; it has become very popular, but you and I both know that the breakthrough happens in the integration. What you do as a licensed clinician is not just plug them into an IV drip and expect things to get better. You work with them on it, and you need to portray that to them. You need to get that across to them by educating, by showing testimonials, by showing stories, and by having a deeper marketing funnel that is going to get you qualified leads that understand the value of what you actually do. What you need isn't just "lead generation." You need an education-first journey that prepares a struggling patient for why KAP works when other treatments fail, so that by the time you speak with them, they already trust you. So how do you do that? Well, we build everything out for you, and you don't need to pay us overpriced monthly retainers. We build the funnel, we run the ads, and soon, we'll have a clinical team pre-screen every single inquiry. And the best thing is? We only charge $99 per qualified patient—meaning they are cash-pay, pre-educated on your clinical model, and ready for an intake call. If they don't meet your clinical standard, you don't pay. But take note, this is not for everyone. To make this work, we have strict requirements. You must have LegitScript certification, be willing to film organic video content, and commit to at least $100 a day in ad spend to get real volume. You do the clinical work to heal treatment-resistant depression; we handle the operational friction to get those patients in your chair. We are on a mission to reach 100,000 people, and we need partners who are ready to scale with us. We only partner with one clinic per market.

Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapists. The only reason that your marketing never really worked up until today is because you were marketing the wrong thing. Here’s what that means and how to fix it. When a patient searches for ketamine, they are usually comparing prices for a standard IV infusion clinic. If your website and your content look exactly like theirs, you commoditize yourself. You are a licensed psychotherapist. You provide clinical integration, meaning you actually help them process the neuroplasticity that the medicine unlocks. Your content, marketing and website needs to highlight the profound difference between a "software patch" like an SSRI, a standard Ketamine infusion, and true Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy. You have to educate the patient that the medicine opens the door, but the therapy walks them through it. If you don't explain that distinction clearly, you will spend all your intake calls defending your highly-justified pricing against a discount IV clinic down the street. Now you are not a marketer, and you probably hate marketing. It feels salesy to you, but the thing is, if you don't market your services, you will not help the people that you need to help. It's very simple: there's millions of people that are still on antidepressants and are not aware of the solutions that you have to offer. So here's what we're going to do: We're going to build you a completely new, premium website at no cost, and no hidden fees, that is going to show your unique differentiator, educate your patients, and make you look like the professional you are.

You spent thousands getting certified in Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy. But right now, your primary marketing strategy is hoping a patient finds your profile on a shared medical directory. And that is exactly why you feel like you are competing on price. When a patient is scrolling through a directory, they see 50 identical faces. They do not understand the neuroplasticity of ketamine. They do not understand the difference between a temporary software patch like an SSRI, and the absolute hardware reset that happens during clinical integration with KAP. All they see is the price per session. When you sit on a directory, your profound, life-changing therapeutic work is reduced to a commodity. Now, you probably hate marketing. It feels salesy to you. And maybe you even worked with a marketing agency in the past and you got disappointed. But there’s 2 harsh truths you need to understand: 1. If you don't market your services, you won’t be able to help the people that you need to help. It's very simple: there's millions of people that quite literally need you and they are not even aware of it 2. You’ll keep fighting for leads and commoditizing your services against other people. So here's what's going to happen. We are not going to charge you a dime for a marketing retainer because if you've been disappointed, we know how hard it is to trust somebody else and believe that they can get you different results. So that’s our approach: We're going to build you a completely new, premium website at no cost, and no hidden fees, that is going to show your unique clinical voice, educate your patients, and make you look like the professional you are.

Short ad Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapist: Stop commoditizing your services in directories and do this instead. I've done research on more than a hundred websites of clinics that offer ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, and they have a very big problem. Their websites are just not doing the job that they're supposed to do. Meaning, if your main service is ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, this is what your main page and your website should focus on. You should have blog posts on it. You should have content. You should have testimonials. On over 100 websites, I have not seen any of these things. So I realize there's a huge gap. Your website is probably not generating you leads because it's not optimized. So you are sitting and competing for patients in directories and commoditizing your service. Maybe you even hired a marketing agency, but they didn't even understand what's the difference between a ketamine infusion and the profound change that you offer.
