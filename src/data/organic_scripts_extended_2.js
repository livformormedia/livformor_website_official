        body: `A patient books a consultation on Tuesday for a Friday appointment. 
You send them one automated email saying 'Appointment Confirmed.' 
By Thursday, their anxiety has spiked. They start researching terrifying anecdotal stories on Reddit. They convince themselves ketamine is dangerous. Friday comes, and they ghost you.
You didn't manage the gap. 
Between booking and showing up, you must actively reduce their anxiety. 
On Wednesday, text them a video of you explaining how safe and closely monitored the session is. On Thursday, email them a success story from a patient who used to be just as scared as they are. On Friday morning, text a warm reminder.
You have to hold their hand before they even walk in the building. Otherwise, the depression talks them out of it.`,

Why? Because the number one fear a patient has about ketamine therapy isn't the cost. It's the loss of control. It's the fear of a 'bad trip.' It's the fear of being alone in a vulnerable state.
When your ad copy says: 'A medically guided, fully monitored experience in a safe, private room with a dedicated clinician by your side'... you dismantle the fear instantly.
Every piece of your marketing—your images, your videos, your text—must scream safety and guidance. 
If they feel safe before they arrive, they will book. If they feel like they are going to be hooked up to an IV and abandoned, they will bounce.
Sell the guide, not the drug.`,

Be explicitly clear. 'Initial medically guided session: $190. Full transformational series: $3,000. Financing available starting at $150 a month.' 
Now, when your front desk gets a call, the patient already knows the math. The conversation and the consultation isn't about defending your price. It's solely about answering their clinical questions. 
Weed out the people who legitimately can't afford it automatically, and focus your staff's energy on the ones who can.`,
