When they can visualize the physical space where the healing will happen, their anxiety drops. 
Social media for clinics shouldn't just be memes and quotes. It should be aggressive demystification of the treatment process. 
Show the chair. Show the room. Show the staff's faces.`,

Imagine waking up, and the first thought you have isn't dread. Imagine making breakfast for your kids and actually being present. Imagine the silence in your head.'
You have to give them permission to hope again, before you can ever ask them for a credit card.`,

Your marketing must emphasize integration.
