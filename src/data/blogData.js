Here's the uncomfortable truth: **most ketamine clinics are marketing like it's 2019.** The clinics that are growing — adding 20, 30, even 50 new patients per month — aren't doing anything revolutionary. They're just avoiding the mistakes everyone else is making.

After working with ketamine and TMS clinics across the country, here are the 7 marketing mistakes we see most often — and exactly how to fix each one.

## Mistake #1: Your Website Talks About You Instead of Your Patient

**What's happening:** Your homepage leads with "Welcome to [Clinic Name]. We are a state-of-the-art ketamine infusion center offering cutting-edge treatment..."

**Why it fails:** Patients with treatment-resistant depression don't care about your facility being "state-of-the-art." They've been failed by state-of-the-art psychiatric care for years. What they need to hear is: *"You've tried everything. Nothing has worked. We understand — and there's a reason antidepressants failed you."*

**The fix:** Lead every page with *empathy-first messaging*. Before you mention your credentials, validate the patient's struggle. Use the actual language patients use — "living in fog," "feeling trapped," "I've tried every medication." Our data shows clinics that switch to empathy-first copy see 35-50% more form submissions.

> **Action Step:** Rewrite your homepage hero section. Remove "Welcome to." Replace it with a single sentence that mirrors your patient's internal monologue.

---

## Mistake #2: You Have No Speed-to-Lead System

**What's happening:** A patient fills out your contact form at 10 PM on a Tuesday. Your front desk calls them back at 9 AM Wednesday — 11 hours later.

**Why it fails:** By 9 AM, that patient has already filled out 2-3 other clinic forms. The first clinic to respond wins 78% of the time (InsideSales.com). For ketamine clinics specifically, speed matters even more — these patients made an emotional decision to reach out, and that window closes fast.

**The fix:** Implement a sub-60-second response system:
1. **Automated text** within 30 seconds of form submission: "Hi [Name], this is [Clinic]. We got your message and want to help. Can we call you in the next 10 minutes?"
2. **Automated email** with a Calendly link for same-day consultation
3. **Live call** within 5 minutes during business hours

> **Action Step:** Set up an automated text response today. Tools like GoHighLevel, Twilio, or even a simple Zapier + Google Voice setup can do this in under an hour.

## Mistake #3: You're Running Google Ads to Your Homepage

**What's happening:** You're spending $3,000-$5,000/month on Google Ads, and every click goes to your homepage — which has your about page, blog links, and 8 different navigation options.

**Why it fails:** Every additional link on a landing page reduces conversions by 12% (Unbounce). Your homepage is designed for browsing. Ads need a page designed for *one thing*: getting the patient to book.

**The fix:** Build dedicated landing pages for each ad campaign:
- **Ketamine for depression** → Landing page about depression
- **Ketamine for PTSD** → Different landing page, different testimonials
- **Spravato covered by insurance** → Insurance-focused page with carrier logos

Each page should have exactly ONE action: call or fill out a form. No navigation bar, no blog links, no distractions.

> **Action Step:** Create one single-purpose landing page for your highest-spending ad campaign. Strip out the navigation. Add a phone number and a 3-field form (name, phone, "what brings you in").

## Mistake #4: You're Invisible on Social Media When Your Patients Are Searching

**What's happening:** Your clinic has an Instagram page with a logo as the profile picture, 12 posts from 2023, and zero stories in the last month.

**Why it fails:** 71% of patients research a provider on social media before booking (Software Advice). An empty or abandoned social media presence signals one thing: *this clinic might not be legitimate.*

**The fix:** You don't need to be an influencer. You need a *consistent, trust-building presence*:
- 3 posts per week (educational carousels, patient stories, "day in the life")
- Use AI video tools to create professional content without a production team
- Post success stories (HIPAA-compliant, anonymized or with consent)
- Engage with comments — especially questions

> **Action Step:** Batch-create 12 Instagram carousels (one month of content). Topics: "What is ketamine therapy?", "5 signs you might benefit from TMS," "What to expect during your first infusion."

---

## Mistake #5: You Don't Track Where Your Patients Come From

**What's happening:** You have a Facebook Pixel and Google Analytics installed, but nobody is looking at the data. You don't know which channel produces your best patients.

**Why it fails:** Without attribution, you're spending money on channels that may not be working — and underinvesting in the ones that are. We've audited clinics spending $4,000/month on Google Ads when 80% of their booked patients actually came from Google organic search.

**The fix:** Implement a simple tracking system:
1. **Unique phone numbers** for each channel (Google Ads, Facebook, organic)
2. **UTM parameters** on every advertising link
3. **"How did you hear about us?"** on every intake form
4. **Monthly review** of cost-per-acquired-patient by channel

> **Action Step:** Add a "How did you hear about us?" dropdown to your contact form with options: Google Search, Facebook/Instagram, Referral, Directory, Other.

---

## Mistake #6: Your Google Business Profile Is an Afterthought

**What's happening:** Your Google Business Profile has your address and phone number. Maybe a few photos from when you opened. Zero posts. Possibly a few unanswered reviews.

**Why it fails:** For local searches like "ketamine clinic near me" or "TMS therapy [city]," your Google Business Profile IS your homepage. Google's AI Overviews now pull directly from GBP data. If your profile is thin, you're invisible to the patients who are most ready to book.

**The fix:**
- **Post weekly** with updates, offers, or educational content
- **Respond to every review** within 24 hours (positive and negative)
- **Upload fresh photos** monthly
- **Fill out every field** — services, hours, description, Q&A
- **Add keywords** naturally to your business description

> **Action Step:** Log into your Google Business Profile today. Add your services (list each treatment individually), upload 5 new photos, and write a 750-character description that includes your target keywords.

## Mistake #7: You Have No Follow-Up System After the First Call

**What's happening:** A potential patient calls, shows interest, says "let me think about it" — and you never hear from them again. No follow-up text. No email sequence. Nothing.

**Why it fails:** Patients considering ketamine therapy are battling "protective pessimism" — after years of failed treatments, they're afraid to hope. That "let me think about it" isn't rejection; it's fear. Without follow-up, you're confirming their belief that no one really cares.

**The fix:** Build a 7-touch follow-up sequence:
1. **Same day:** Text/email with a testimonial from a similar patient
2. **Day 2:** Email with "What to expect during your first visit" guide
3. **Day 4:** Text checking in: "Any questions I can answer about the treatment?"
4. **Day 7:** Email with a patient success story video
5. **Day 10:** "Just checking in" call from the front desk
6. **Day 14:** Final email with limited-time consultation offer
7. **Day 30:** Re-engagement email with new clinic news or research

> **Action Step:** Write the Day 1 text message right now. Something like: "Hi [Name], it was great speaking with you today. I wanted to share a quick story from a patient who felt the same way you do: [testimonial link]. No pressure — we're here when you're ready."

---

## The Bottom Line

None of these fixes require a massive budget. None require hiring a marketing team. What they do require is a shift from "we exist, come find us" to "we understand you, let us help you take the first step."

**The clinics that are winning aren't the ones with the fanciest offices or the most experienced doctors.** They're the ones who market with empathy, respond with speed, and follow up with persistence.`
