When an agency charges you a flat $5,000 a month, their financial incentive stops the moment the check clears. Whether they deliver 5 patients or 50, they get paid exactly the same. 
Their goal isn't to maximize your clinic's growth. Their goal is to do just enough work to keep you from canceling the contract. They are managing your satisfaction, not your patient acquisition.
That's why we don't charge retainers. We charge $99 per qualified inquiry. A real patient, prescreened by our team, who actually wants treatment. If we don't deliver, we make zero. 
We took the financial risk off your clinic and put it on ourselves. Because that's the only way incentives actually align.`,

They want to hear your voice. They want to see your empathy. 
The easiest way to double your clinic's trust factor overnight is for the founder or patient inquiry clinician to pick up an iPhone and talk to the camera. 
Explain the process. Talk about why you started the clinic. Answer common questions. 
It doesn't need to be highly produced. In fact, raw and authentic converts better because it feels real. Your face builds the bridge that your ads walk across.`,

Worse, it attracts bargain hunters who will fight you on the price of every maintenance booster forever.
If you need to lower the barrier to entry to get people in the door, don't discount the treatment plan. Create a specific, standalone intro offer. 
A $190 first session is not a discount. It is an initial evaluation and trial. 
It lets the patient experience the mechanism without committing to the full $3,000 treatment plan. 
It preserves the integrity of your full-price series, while still breaking down the financial fear that stops them from calling. Protect your pricing. Lower the risk instead.`,
