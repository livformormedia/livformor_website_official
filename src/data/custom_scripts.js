Most clinic owners in this space have been burned. You paid an agency a monthly retainer. They ran ads. Unqualified patients came in. Nobody showed. You paid again the next month anyway.

What we built is the opposite of that model.

You pay $99 per booked consultation. That's it. No retainer. No setup fee. No contract.

And before we launch a single ad — we sit down with you and agree on exactly what a booked consultation means for your clinic. Cash-pay. First contact with your practice. Pre-screened by our team. If it doesn't meet the standard you set, you don't pay.

But this isn't for everybody. Before we take on a clinic, there are three things we need to see.

One: You need to be running at least $100 a day in ad spend. This isn't for clinics that want to test with $500 a month. This is a real patient acquisition system that requires real volume.

Two: You need LegitScript certification. If you're running ketamine or Spravato ads on Google or Meta without it, your account will get suspended — and we can't run your campaigns without it. If you don't have it yet, we'll help you get it. But it needs to happen.

Three: You need to be willing to be on video. Ketamine and TMS are high-trust treatments. The clinics that win in this market are the ones where the owner shows up on camera. Stock photos don't build trust. Faces do.

If you check those three boxes — your cash-pay ketamine or TMS clinic is exactly who we built this for.

They took your money on month one and ran ads to your homepage. Not a dedicated landing page — your homepage. With your navigation bar, six links, a staff photo. Every extra link on a landing page reduces your conversion rate. The traffic was there. The infrastructure wasn't built to catch it.

Month two: same thing. Maybe they updated the creative. You still paid.

When a patient inquiry did come in — someone who actually filled out your form, left their name and number, expressed interest in ketamine therapy — your team called them back a day later. MIT research is clear: you have a 5-minute window. After 5 minutes, the odds of qualifying that patient inquiry drop 80%. Your agency never told you that.

And when the patient inquiry said "let me think about it" — they sent one follow-up email and moved on. The patient considering ketamine for treatment-resistant depression who says "let me think about it" isn't saying no. They're scared. You needed seven touches minimum. You got one.

That's not bad marketing strategy. That's no strategy at all.

Here's what working with us looks like: you pay nothing until we deliver a booked consultation. $99 per pre-screened, cash-pay prospect who has been contacted by our team and consented to hear from your clinic. No retainer. No setup fee.

And before we launch — we sit down and define together exactly what a booked consultation means for you. You set the standard. We hit it.

One clinic per market. Your competitors don't get access to what we learn building your campaigns.

If we don't deliver — you don't owe us a cent.

No agency offers this because most agencies can't back it up. They need the retainer because they're not confident enough in their results to tie their income to them. We are.

Now — this isn't for every clinic. There are three things we need from you before we'll even take on your market.

You need to be spending at least $100 a day in ad budget. This system is built for volume. It doesn't work on $500 a month.

You need LegitScript certification — or be willing to get it. Without it, you can't run ketamine or Spravato ads on Google or Meta without getting your account banned. We can walk you through the application. But it has to happen.

And you need to be willing to show your face on camera. The clinics winning in this market have owners who show up on video. This is not optional if you want to compete.

Two: LegitScript certification. Running ketamine or Spravato ads on Google or Meta without LegitScript is how you get your account suspended. It's not optional. If you don't have it yet, we'll help you get it. But it has to be in place before we launch.

Three: Willingness to be on video. Your face. On camera. On TikTok, Reels, YouTube — regularly. The ketamine and TMS clinics that are growing right now are the ones where the owner shows up. Not stock photos. Not text graphics. You, on camera, talking about what you do and why it matters.

It's not the platform. It's not the algorithm. It's not that people aren't interested.

It's your infrastructure.

I've looked at the marketing setup of over 40 ketamine and TMS clinics. Almost all of them had the same three problems.

Their landing pages weren't built to convert. They were sending paid traffic to their homepage — with a navigation bar full of links and a "Welcome to our clinic" headline. Every extra link is an exit. The traffic was there. The system wasn't built to convert it.

Their response time was broken. MIT research: you have a 5-minute window to respond before your odds of qualifying that patient inquiry drop 80%. These clinics were calling back 24 hours later. The window was closed.

And they stopped at one or two follow-ups. A patient considering ketamine therapy for treatment-resistant depression who says "let me think about it" is scared — not gone. You need 7 touches minimum. They were sending one email and giving up.

Fix those three things — and the marketing that "doesn't work" suddenly starts working.

That's what we do. And we don't charge you until it does.

$99 per booked consultation. Before we start, we sit down and agree on exactly what that means — so you're never paying for a patient inquiry that doesn't meet your standard. No retainer.

It's not a scam. But your agency probably failed you. And there's a difference.

Here are the questions nobody asked you after it fell apart. Were the patient inquiries even qualified — or were they random people clicking on generic stock photo ads? When someone filled out your form, how fast did someone call them? Because MIT research shows that after 5 minutes, the odds of reaching a patient inquiry drop by 80%. Five minutes. And that's if you screened them at all before they gave you their name.

What did your ads actually look like? Clinical claims? Stock images? Or was there a real person — on camera — talking directly to the people who haven't found relief anywhere else? And your offer — was it a "free consultation"? That phrase is invisible in a crowded market. The right framing is the difference between a full calendar and an empty one.

Most agencies have one job: generate patient inquiries. Then they send you a report and call it a month. They don't help you call faster. They don't help you screen. They don't help you frame the offer. And they charge you the same retainer whether you closed anyone or not.

That's why it didn't work. Not because marketing is broken. Because the model is broken.`,

Here is how it works. It's very simple. We come in and install our complete patient acquisition infrastructure to bring you financially and medically qualified patients. We handle the direct-response strategy, the ads, the landing pages, the pre-screening, and the tracking. 

But here is the catch. Because we take on the risk, we do not work with just any clinic. You need to have the operational capacity to handle volume, a budget that shows you're serious about growth, and a commitment to answering the phone when a patient needs you.

I dug deeper — and I found three patterns that showed up every single time.

Pattern one: They were sending paid traffic to their homepage. Not a dedicated landing page — their homepage. With six navigation links, a staff photo, and a "Welcome to our clinic" headline. Every extra link on a landing page bleeds your conversion rate. The traffic was there. The infrastructure wasn't built to catch it.

Pattern two: Their response time was broken. MIT research is clear — you have a 5-minute window to respond before your odds of qualifying a patient inquiry drop 80%. These clinics were calling back hours later. Sometimes the next day. The window was closed. The patient had moved on.

Pattern three: They stopped at one or two follow-ups. A patient considering ketamine therapy for treatment-resistant depression is scared. "Let me think about it" is not a no. It's fear. It means: I want this, but I'm terrified. Without 7 touches minimum, you're leaving the people who needed you most with no one showing up for them.

That's what we fix. And it's not complex. It's just a system.

The demand for ketamine and TMS therapy is real and growing. The problem was never the market. It was the infrastructure.

100,000 people who beat treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health conditions — through a ketamine or TMS clinic that we helped grow.

Let me tell you why that number doesn't feel impossible.

Right now, depression diagnoses are at record highs. Anxiety disorders are affecting more people than ever. PTSD is destroying the lives of millions of veterans, trauma survivors, people who've been through things they can't even put into words.

The country is more divided than ever. AI, political chaos, economic fear — all of it is making people feel like there's no way forward.

And there are treatments that have been proven — clinically, repeatedly — to work for people when nothing else has. Ketamine. TMS. Spravato. These are not experimental anymore. These are real tools in the hands of real clinic owners who got into this because they believe in the treatment.

The problem isn't the treatment. It's the marketing.

Most clinic owners are extraordinary clinicians. They are not marketers. They shouldn't have to be. That's what we're here for.

If we can help enough clinics reach enough of the right patients — the downstream impact is real. Not a dashboard stat. A person who can get out of bed. Who can be present for their family. Who is still here.

That's the 100,000 we're building toward.

Here is the psychology of the person you're trying to reach.

They've been suffering for years. They've tried SSRIs, maybe more than once. They've been in therapy. They've read about ketamine or TMS and they're hopeful — but they're also exhausted at the idea of trying another thing that might not work.

When your ad says "FDA-approved treatment for depression" — it triggers logic, not emotion. And with this audience, you need emotion first. Always.

You need them to feel understood before they feel interested.

What actually stops someone mid-scroll is a sentence that makes them think: "That's me. They're describing me."

"You've tried everything. The medication. The therapy. You're still here, still struggling — and somewhere in the back of your mind, you're starting to wonder if this is just how life is going to be."

That's a hook. That opens a door.

Then — you introduce ketamine or TMS not as a product, but as a mechanism. The specific reason it works differently for people who didn't respond to traditional treatment. The science, in plain language.

Emotion first. Mechanism second. Proof third. One clear CTA last.

That's the formula. And none of it involves "FDA-approved."

Here's exactly why I don't.

First — if I'm running campaigns for two ketamine clinics in the same city, I'm competing against myself. Splitting data, splitting attention, splitting results. That's not a model built to win. It's a model built to spread responsibility thin enough that nobody has to take it seriously.

Second — exclusivity is part of what I'm selling. When you work with us, you're the only ketamine or TMS clinic in your market with our full system, our full attention, and everything we learn about patient acquisition in your specific geography. Your competitor can't access that.

Third — I want each clinic I work with to reach full capacity. Not partial capacity. Not "a little better than before." Full. That's the ambition. And you can't hold that ambition for ten clinics simultaneously.

We're not a volume operation. We don't onboard fifty clinics into a dashboard and run the same templated campaigns.

Every clinic we decide to work with is a deliberate choice. We have to believe we can get them there. Because the model only works — for us and for you — when patients actually show up.

Here's what a complete clinic marketing system actually looks like.

One: A dedicated landing page. Not your homepage. A page built for one specific treatment — ketamine, TMS, or Spravato — with one clear promise and one CTA. Every navigation link you leave on that page is a reason for someone to leave without committing.

Two: A paid channel. Google Ads for people actively searching for ketamine therapy or TMS near them. Meta for people who don't know they have options yet — which is a significantly larger audience than most clinics are targeting.

Three: Speed to patient inquiry. The moment someone fills out your form, they receive a response within 60 seconds. Automated, but personal. The 5-minute window is real — and it closes faster than most clinic owners think.

Four: A follow-up sequence. Seven touches minimum. Email, SMS, phone call. In a specific cadence. Most clinics send one email and give up. The patients who needed seven follow-ups to book a consultation are often the most committed patients you'll ever treat.

Five: Organic content. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube. Educational content that answers the questions your future patients are already asking. This doesn't just build your brand — it makes every paid ad you run convert at a dramatically higher rate because they've already seen you before they clicked.

These five things, running simultaneously. That's not a secret. That's just the system — when all of it is actually working.

            ],
            body: `Here's how I would scale a cash-pay ketamine or TMS clinic in 2026.

My name is Oriel. I've run paid campaigns across 63 industries. Six months ago I walked away from all of it to focus exclusively on this space — because a close friend of mine is numb. Not sad. Not struggling. Numb. SSRIs, weed to cope. He is not the same person. And I realized the clinics that could actually help him couldn't reach him. So that's why I'm here.

Here's the framework. Five components. In the order I'd build them.

──────────

Component one: Be everywhere. Not just ads — everywhere.

Your CEO needs to be on camera. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube. Showing their face. Talking about the treatment. Building trust before the patient ever searches for you. At the same time — run paid ads on Instagram and Google simultaneously. Instagram for people who don't know they have options yet. Google for people who are actively searching. When a patient sees your face on their feed and then sees your ad on Google, something shifts. You go from a clinic to a known person. Trust happens at the intersection of frequency and familiarity, not just one ad.

Component two: Education-based marketing.

You are not selling a treatment. You are teaching someone why they are still suffering — and why the thing they haven't tried yet might be the reason they start to heal. If your ads patient inquiry with "FDA-approved" or a list of services, you're speaking to the logical brain. And this patient isn't here for logic. They're exhausted. They've been let down. You have to earn their belief before you earn their inquiry. Teach them the mechanism. Why ketamine works when SSRIs don't. Why TMS targets a different pathway. Give them language for what they've been feeling. Make them feel understood before they feel interested. That's how inquiries become consultations.

Component three: Five-minute follow-up. Not as a courtesy — as a system.

MIT research is clear: you have a five-minute window from the moment someone fills out your form before your odds of qualifying that patient inquiry drop by 80%. Five minutes. Not 24 hours. Not the next morning. Five minutes. The moment someone reaches out, they need to feel it. An automated text with a short personal video from the doctor. A call from a care coordinator. A piece of content that speaks directly to what they're going through. Not a confirmation email. A signal that says: we saw you, we're here, and you're not waiting. Book them directly to a consultation. The consultation is not the close — it's the next natural step for someone who just reached out at their most vulnerable moment. Make it easy. Make it fast. Make it feel human.

Component four: Stay with the scared ones.

Most patients considering ketamine or TMS therapy are terrified. Not because they don't believe in the treatment — but because they've been disappointed so many times before that hope feels dangerous. When they say "let me think about it," that is not a no. That is fear. Seven follow-ups minimum. Every touch point should say one thing: I'm still here. I believe we can help you. I'm not going anywhere. Not aggressive. Not pushy. Just present. Because the patient who needs seven touches to book a consultation is often the one who becomes your most loyal, most vocal, most transformed patient. Don't let them walk away because no one followed up.

Component five: Never give up on a no-show.

Some patients book a consultation and don't come. Life happens. Fear wins, temporarily. They went back to what's familiar, even if it's not working. Do not treat this as a lost patient. They booked. They raised their hand. They wanted this. Call them. Send a message. Not a script — a human one. Let them know you remember them. That the door is still open. That you're not following up because of the revenue — you're following up because you know what they're going through and you know what's possible for them when they walk through yours. The clinics that recover no-shows are the clinics that actually change lives at scale.

──────────

That's the framework. Omnipresence. Education. Five-minute follow-up. Fear nurture. No-show recovery.

Most clinics are running one or two of these. The ones that run all five — those are the ones that fill their calendars and actually serve the people who need them most.

            body: `If you own a ketamine or TMS clinic and you feel like marketing isn't working for you — before you blame the platform or the agency, answer these four questions honestly.

One: What type of ads are you running? Are you leading with clinical claims — "FDA-approved," "treatment-resistant depression"? Or are you using psychology, stories, analogies, testimonials, and real data that makes someone believe there is a better solution than the SSRIs they've already tried?

Two: What medium are you using? Random stock photos and generic images — or video? Are you on TikTok, Reels, YouTube? Are you letting people see your face and hear your voice? Authority in this space is built with presence, not graphics.

Three: How fast do you call your patient inquiries? Within 5 minutes of someone filling out your form — or 24 hours later? People dealing with depression especially need to feel seen the moment they reach out. The faster you respond, the more human you feel.

Four: Do you have an intro offer? Do you charge full price immediately — or do you let someone experience what you do first? Charging $190 for a first session instead of $400 or $500 changes everything. Let them feel what it does. You know what it does.

Here's the truth: there is no problem with the market. There is no problem with any platform. The demand is growing. More and more people are being diagnosed with depression and PTSD. They are looking for solutions.

The patient who lands on your website isn't reading your credentials. They're not looking at your awards or your staff photos. They're asking one question, silently: "Is this for someone like me? Can these people actually help me?"

If the first thing they see is your accolades, your navigation bar with six links, or your "state-of-the-art infusion center" headline — you've already lost them. You're speaking to yourself. And they came to hear about themselves.

Here's what the top of a converting ketamine or TMS landing page communicates:

"You've tried everything. The medication. The therapy. You're still struggling. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you're starting to wonder if this is just how life is going to be. It doesn't have to be."

Empathy first. Credentials second. Every time.

Then — one action to take. Not six links. Not a full navigation menu. One form. One button. Book your free call. That's it.

Every extra option you give someone is a potential exit. Every moment they spend thinking about what to click next is a moment they're not feeling understood.

Depression diagnoses are at record highs. Anxiety disorders are affecting more people than ever before. PTSD is destroying millions of lives. The country is more divided than it's been in decades. AI, political chaos, wars, economic instability — all of it is making people feel hopeless. Like there's no way forward.

And there are treatments that actually work for these people. Ketamine, TMS, and Spravato — all clinically proven to help patients who haven't responded to traditional treatment. The evidence base is real. The patient outcomes are real.

But most clinics are invisible to the people who need them most.

Not because the demand isn't there. Because the marketing system isn't built to reach it.

The patient searching for "ketamine therapy near me" at 11pm while they can't sleep — if your landing page isn't converting, if your response takes 24 hours, if your social media shows posts from last year — they move on. They find someone else. Or worse, they stop looking entirely.

Every clinic I've worked with that actually grew — did the same things. They built a dedicated landing page. They automated their response time. They showed up consistently on video. They followed up seven times.

That's it. No secret. No hack. Just the system working as it should.

Are you asking someone who has been suffering for years — who is terrified, who has already failed at multiple other treatments, who doesn't know if anything will ever work — to commit $400, $500, or more before they've experienced a single thing you do?

Because that is an enormous ask.

Here is a different model: charge $190 for the first session. Just let them in the door.

You know what ketamine does. You've watched it work. You've seen people come in as one version of themselves and walk out changed. You know the experience is the sale. So let it do the selling.

Lower the barrier to that first yes — make it almost impossible to say no to just trying once. And then let the treatment prove itself.

Clinics that use an intro-offer model close more first sessions. And they convert those first sessions into full treatment series at a much higher rate — because now the patient isn't buying a concept. They bought an experience. They felt it. They know what it does for them personally.

Your full-price series is not harder to sell after a $190 first session. It is dramatically easier. Because the patient is no longer hoping it might work. They know it does.

Think carefully about what your first "yes" is really asking for.`,

Content without a capture system is just noise. You can post every single day — and if there is no link in bio, no conversion-focused landing page, no form, no follow-up sequence behind it — you are building awareness with no mechanism to turn that awareness into a consultation. You are filling a bucket with no bottom.

Here is what actually works for ketamine and TMS clinic social media:

Your content educates. Your bio link captures. And there has to be a direct, frictionless path from the video someone just watched to the form they fill out.

Every piece of content you post should answer one of three questions: What is this treatment and how does it actually work? Is this right for someone like me? What's the first step to finding out?

Answer those three questions in rotation. Put one CTA in every video — the same CTA, every time: link in bio. That link goes to a landing page designed to do one thing.

The content was never the problem. The system behind the content was.

It is what happens after someone fills out the form.

The MIT research on patient inquiry response time is definitive: your odds of reaching and qualifying a patient inquiry drop by 80 percent after 5 minutes. Not 5 hours. 5 minutes.

Here's what is actually happening when a patient submits a form at your clinic.

They made an emotional decision. They've been suffering for months or years. They finally did something about it. They found you, they filled out your form, they hit submit. In that moment, they are emotionally present in the decision.

But if your team calls them back an hour later, or the next morning, or — which happens more often than anyone wants to admit — two days later? The window is closed. They've second-guessed themselves. "It's probably too expensive. It probably won't work for me. Let me think about it a little more."

That's not a no. That's fear winning because you weren't there when the window was open.

The fix is one automated text message, sent within 60 seconds of form submission: "Hi — we received your message. We'd love to connect in the next 10 minutes. Is now a good time?" That message, alone, has doubled consultation bookings at clinics I've worked with — without changing a single word of their ads.

Here is how a patient actually finds you in 2026.

They see a video. Maybe it's you explaining how ketamine works differently from an antidepressant. Maybe it's a patient story. Maybe it's you looking directly into the camera saying: "If you've been on SSRIs for years and they haven't worked, there may be a very specific reason for that."

They watch. They follow. They see more. They start to trust you before they have ever set foot inside your clinic.

And then — when they're ready to take action, which research shows takes an average of 7 touchpoints for a healthcare decision of this magnitude — they already feel like they know you. The barrier to booking is dramatically lower.

Stock photos do not build that kind of trust. Generic infographics do not build that trust. Your face does.

You don't need a professional studio. You don't need a lighting setup or a camera crew or a script that sounds polished. You need a phone, a quiet room, and something real to say about what you do and why it matters.

The patients they lost by stopping there are often the most motivated patients they never got to treat.

Here's the psychology of someone considering ketamine therapy or TMS for treatment-resistant depression.

They've been suffering for a long time. They've tried other things. They filled out your form, which means they made an actual decision to reach out. But they're scared. "Let me think about it" is not a no. It's fear. It means: I want to try this, but I'm not sure I deserve it, or that it'll work, or that I'm ready.

If you follow up once and go silent, you've confirmed their doubt. You've signaled that you don't really believe in what you're offering enough to keep showing up.

Seven touches is the research-backed minimum for a healthcare decision of this type and price point. A call the day of. An email the next morning. An SMS two days later. Another call on day four. And so on. In a specific sequence.

You are not harassing them. You are standing for something you believe can change their life.

The script for the seventh follow-up that actually converts: "I've reached out a few times and I don't want to bother you — but I genuinely believe this could help you. If the timing isn't right, I completely understand. I just didn't want to stop without giving you every possible chance to say yes."

That message, at attempt seven, books patients who have been sitting on the decision for three weeks.

In a well-run Google Ads campaign for a ketamine clinic — cost per click is $8 to $15 depending on the market. With a properly built landing page and a follow-up sequence, cost per consultation booked is $75 to $150. With solid show rates and a strong consultation process, your cost to acquire a patient who completes a full treatment series is $300 to $500.

A ketamine infusion series: $4,000 to $8,000. Spravato treatment protocol: $6,000 to $20,000. TMS: $3,000 to $6,000.

You are spending $300 to $500 to bring in a patient worth $4,000 to $20,000.

That is a 10 to 40 times return on what you spent.

The math works. It has always worked. The question is never whether the math works. The question is whether your marketing infrastructure is built to let it work.

Most clinic campaigns I audit are not. They are sending traffic to their homepage instead of a dedicated landing page. They're missing LegitScript certification for ketamine and Spravato. They have no automated follow-up. They're calling patient inquiries back 24 hours later.

Fix those things and the economics of running paid ads for your clinic become completely, obviously different.

Here's what we know:
Traditional marketing works for about 30-40% of standard wellness clinics. 
But if you're offering profound clinical integration? You're told to "spend more on ad budget."
And another thousand. And another.
It's exhausting.

But here's the thing most agencies won't tell you:
If you're not booking enough consultations, the problem isn't the algorithm. 
The problem is that your marketing needs a fundamental shift from 'selling medicine' to 'selling a clinical breakthrough.'

That's where the LivForMor Performance Model comes in.
We don't charge you a retainer. We don't guess.
We sit down with you and define exactly what a highly qualified, clinically appropriate patient looks like for your practice.
You pay $99 per booked consultation that meets your exact criteria. 
That's it. 

We see an 85% qualification rate in patients our systems generate. 
85%.

So here's why we're reaching out:
We're looking for 5 Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapists who:
✓ Have tried standard agencies without lasting relief
✓ Are still struggling with unqualified intake calls
✓ Are open to trying a performance-based, zero-retainer acquisition model
✓ Want to finally break free from the cycle of bad marketing

If that's you, we'd like to offer you a free growth assessment to see if your market is open.
No pressure. No commitment. Just a conversation.

You spent years completing specialized training to guide patients through profound trauma. You understand the non-ordinary states of consciousness. You know the protocols. 

But when patients find you online, all they see is a price tag for an "infusion."

They ask you why you are more expensive than the MedSpa down the street. They ask you how fast it takes. They think it's a hardware fix, when really, it's a software rewiring.

The problem is your marketing. It's treating you like a standard IV drip clinic. 

You need messaging that elevates your clinical authority. Messaging that explains why integration therapy is the actual difference between temporary relief and a lifelong breakthrough.

You already know that the breakthrough happens in the integration, not just the medicine. But standard marketing often misses that. It runs broad ads for 'Ketamine Therapy,' generating low-intent inquiries who are just price-shopping for an IV drip. It exhausts your intake team and forces you to constantly justify the cost of the psychotherapy component.

Marketing a profound modality like KAP requires an education-first patient journey. We've seen this across dozens of clinics—when you shift from "selling a treatment" to "educating on the breakthrough," your conversion rate doubles. This is because you have to explain to the patient that the medicine opens the door, but the therapy walks them through it.

That is why we built a patient acquisition system specifically for the nuances of Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy. We handle the education and the funnel, so you can focus completely on the clinical work. 

And we do this on a purely performance basis. We pre-screen every single inquiry, and you only pay $99 for a qualified, cash-pay patient who understands your model and is ready for an intake call. 

But we only partner with practitioners who are serious: you need at least $100 a day in ad budget, you must have LegitScript certification, and you must be willing to put your face on camera because stock pictures don't build therapeutic trust. 

Our mission is to help 100,000 people beat treatment-resistant depression, and we need elite KAP practitioners to do it.

You're a licensed clinician. You shouldn't have to chase down unqualified internet leads who don't understand the out-of-pocket investment of KAP, or pay massive monthly retainers just to hope for results.

What you need isn't just "lead generation." You need an education-first journey that prepares a struggling patient for why KAP works when other treatments fail, so that by the time you speak with them, they already trust you.

So we completely flipped the model. We build the funnel, we run the ads, and our clinical team pre-screens every single inquiry. We only charge $99 per qualified patient—meaning they are cash-pay, pre-educated on your clinical model, and ready for an intake call. If they don't meet your clinical standard, you don't pay.

To make this work, we have strict requirements. You must have LegitScript certification, be willing to film organic video content, and commit to at least $100 a day in ad spend to get real volume.

You do the clinical work to heal treatment-resistant depression; we handle the operational friction to get those patients in your chair. We are on a mission to reach 100,000 people, and we need partners who are ready to scale with us.

You have patients with severe PTSD and treatment-resistant depression. You've been doing traditional talk therapy with them for months, maybe years, and the needle just isn't moving. That's exactly why you integrated Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy into your practice. You wanted to give them that hardware-level reset.

But here is the tragic irony. You have this transformative modality, but scaling it feels impossible. You despise "salesy" marketing. You don't want to run aggressive ads. You just want to connect with the patients who desperately need this intervention.

What you need isn't traditional lead generation. You need an education-first patient journey.

You are marketing the medicine, not the integration. Let me explain. 

When a patient searches for ketamine, they are usually comparing prices for a standard IV infusion clinic. If your website and your content look exactly like theirs, you commoditize yourself. You are a licensed psychotherapist. You provide clinical integration, meaning you actually help them process the neuroplasticity that the medicine unlocks.

Your content needs to aggressively highlight the difference between a "software patch" like an SSRI, a standard Ketamine infusion, and true Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy. You have to explain to the patient that the medicine opens the door, but the therapy walks them through it.

If you don't explain that distinction clearly, you will spend all your intake calls defending your highly-justified pricing against a discount IV clinic down the street.

At LivForMor, we solve this by building patient acquisition systems that educate your patients before they even speak to you. We pre-screen them so you only talk to cash-pay patients ready for the therapeutic work—charging you only for the qualified consultations we deliver.

And that is exactly why you feel like you are competing on price. 

When a patient is scrolling through a directory, they see 50 identical faces. They do not understand the neuroplasticity of ketamine. They do not understand the difference between a temporary software patch like an SSRI, and the absolute hardware reset that happens during clinical integration. All they see is the price per session.

When you sit on a directory, your profound, life-changing therapeutic work is reduced to a commodity. 

You cannot scale a cash-pay KAP practice by waiting for patients in a catalog. You need a sovereign patient acquisition system. You need an automated, education-first journey that intercepts the patient *before* they start comparison shopping—a system that explains why they need a licensed psychotherapist to walk them through the door the medicine opens, not just a medical spa to hook up an IV.

That is exactly what we build. We pull you out of the directory trap and build your own independent funnel. We educate the patient, we run the ads, and our clinical team pre-screens every single inquiry.
