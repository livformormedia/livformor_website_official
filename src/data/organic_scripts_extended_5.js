Your top-of-funnel ads for TMS have to be purely educational, heavily focused on the FDA approval and the insurance coverage.

You hook them with the insurance and the non-medication angle. You educate them on the magnets later. Lower the barrier, raise the curiosity.`,

Your time is worth $500 an hour in the treatment room. Why are you spending it doing $25/hour data entry in a marketing platform?
Let an agency handle the ads, the funnels, and the patient inquiries. You focus entirely on the medicine and the patient experience. That is how you scale without losing your mind.`,

We don't fight over the 5% of high-intent searchers. We build marketing campaigns to educate the 95% of people suffering securely on their couches who don't even know this treatment exists.
