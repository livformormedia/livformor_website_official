# LivForMor Niche Dictionary (Ketamine & TMS)

**Purpose**: Document all niche-specific terminology, jargon, acronyms, and language patterns. This allows us to speak fluently to clinic owners and show we are insiders, not outsiders.

## A-Z Terminology

### C
**Cash-Pay**: Patients who pay out-of-pocket for treatments rather than going through insurance. This is the holy grail for clinic revenue.
**Consultation**: The initial meeting with a patient to determine if they are a candidate for treatment. *Do not call this a "sales call" or "pitch".*
**Care Coordinator**: The administrative or clinical staff member responsible for answering initial patient inquiries and getting them booked for consultations. Often the bottleneck in "Speed to Lead."

### I
**Infusion Series**: The standard course of treatment for IV Ketamine, typically consisting of 6 initial infusions over 2-3 weeks.
**Inquiry Flow**: The volume of potential patients reaching out to the clinic. *Do not call them "leads". Call them "patient inquiries".*
**Insurance-Based / In-Network**: Clinics that rely heavily on insurance reimbursements. These clinics have high volume but lower margins per treatment and deal with heavy administrative overhead.

### M
**Maintenance Infusions**: Occasional "booster" infusions a patient receives after completing their initial series, typically every 4-12 weeks.

### P
**Patient**: *Never use "customer" or "client". Always "patient".*
**Pre-screened Inquiry**: A prospective patient who has been vetted financially and medically before taking up the clinic's time. 

### S
**Speed to Lead**: The crucial 5-minute window after a patient submits a form. MIT research shows that the odds of qualifying the patient drop 80% if not contacted within this timeframe.
**Spravato (Esketamine)**: The FDA-approved, insurance-covered nasal spray version of ketamine. Requires a REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) protocol and a 2-hour in-office observation window.
**SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)**: The standard class of antidepressants (e.g., Prozac, Zoloft). The primary frustration for our target patient demographic, as they often don't work and have side effects.

### T
**TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)**: A non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. Often billed to insurance.
**TRD (Treatment-Resistant Depression)**: The medical diagnosis for patients who have not responded adequately to at least two different antidepressant medications. This is the primary target market for Ketamine and TMS.
**Treatment Plan**: The recommended course of action and therapies for a patient. *Never call this a "package" or "offer".*
