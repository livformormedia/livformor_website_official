# LivForMor Market Research Document
**Niche**: Ketamine, Spravato, and TMS Clinics
**Goal**: Understand our market so deeply that we can articulate their problems better than they can. This document synthesizes research from sales calls, YouTube videos, and industry analysis.

## 💰 Revenue & Pricing
*   **The Math Works**: A patient acquisition cost of $300-$500 yields a patient LTV of $4,000-$8,000 for IV Ketamine, and up to $20,000 for a Spravato protocol. The economics are undeniable, but clinics struggle with the *infrastructure* to realize these numbers.
*   **Cash-Pay vs Insurance**: Clinics overwhelmingly prefer cash-pay IV ketamine due to immediate revenue and zero administrative friction. However, Spravato and TMS provide baseline stability because they are insurance-backed.
*   **The $190 First Session**: High ticket resistance. Asking a patient to commit $400-$600 immediately is a massive friction point. Intro offers (e.g., $190 first session) drastically increase conversions by letting the *experience* do the selling.

## 😤 Pain Points & Frustrations
*   **The "Agency Burn"**: Almost every clinic owner has hired an agency, paid a $2,000-$5,000/mo retainer, and received "garbage leads" (people who think it's free, can't afford it, or just clicking for fun).
*   **The Follow-Up Fatigue**: Clinicians are not salespeople. They hate feeling like they're "chasing" leads. They usually follow up once, assume the person isn't interested, and give up.
*   **Empty Chairs**: The dread of walking into the clinic and seeing empty infusion chairs, knowing the fixed overhead (rent, staff, medical director) is burning cash.
*   **No-Shows**: The frustration of a patient booking a consultation and just not showing up, wasting valuable clinician time.

## 🎯 Goals & Desires
*   **The "Number One" Status**: They want to be the undisputed dominant provider in their city. They want competitors to fear their patient acquisition power.
*   **Pre-Screened Patients Only**: They only want to talk to people who are medically qualified and actually have the money to pay for treatments. They want the calendar filled automatically.
*   **Impact**: Beneath the money, these doctors genuinely got into this because SSRIs let their patients down. They want to see lives saved. They want to treat 100,000 people.

## 👥 Team & Staffing
*   **The "Care Coordinator" Bottleneck**: Front desk staff are rarely trained in sales. When an anxious patient calls asking "How much does it cost?", the receptionist drops the price instantly, scaring the patient away, instead of booking a medical consultation to build value.
*   **Owner Dependency**: The clinic owner is often the one doing the marketing, the sales, *and* the medical direction. They are exhausted and need systematic delegation.

## 📈 Sales & Closing
*   **The 5-Minute Window**: MIT data is explicit—calling a lead after 5 minutes drops qualification odds by 80%. Most clinics wait 24 hours.
*   **The 7-Touch Rule**: Patients with TRD are inherently terrified and skeptical. "I need to think about it" is actually fear, not a rejection. They require a minimum of 7 gentle but persistent follow-ups to book, which clinics rarely do.

## 📣 Marketing & Acquisition
*   **Homepage Bleeding**: Clinics send expensive Google/Meta ad traffic straight to their generic homepage. The navigation bar distracts the user, and they leave without booking. They lack dedicated, single-action landing pages.
*   **Logical vs Emotional Ads**: Clinics love to market "FDA-Approved" or "State-of-the-art facilities" (Logic). The patient doesn't care. The patient wants to know "Will this finally make me stop feeling numb?" (Emotion).
*   **Lack of Founder Videos**: Authority is built via video. Stock photos kill trust. The clinics that win are the ones where the doctor looks into the camera and speaks directly to the patient's pain.

## ⚠ Common Mistakes (The "Why It's Broken" Narrative)
1.  Sending paid traffic to a corporate homepage instead of a specialized landing page.
2.  Delaying lead follow-up past the critical 5-minute emotional window.
3.  Stopping follow-up after attempt #2 when TRD patients require 7-10 attempts due to fear and anxiety.
4.  Focusing ads on clinical jargon instead of the patient's emotional exhaustion with SSRIs.
5.  Refusing to lower the barrier to entry (e.g., stubbornly insisting on full-price initial consults).
